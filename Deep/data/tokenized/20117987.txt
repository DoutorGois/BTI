OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhuEPO) on p-Akt and caspase-9 expressions in the hippocampus of rats with status epilepticus (SE) and explore the neuroprotective mechanism of rhuEPO. METHODS: Adult male SD rats were randomized into control, PTZ, rHuEPO, LY294002 group, and DMSO groups and treated with normal saline (NS), PTZ, PTZ+rHuEPO, PTZ+LY294002+rHuEPO, and PTZ+DMSO+rHuEPO, respectively. The behavioral and electroencephalogram (EEG) changes of the rats were recorded, and the expressions of p-Akt and caspase-9 were detected using immunohistochemistry. The hippocampal expression of caspase-9 mRNA was detected using RT-PCR, and the expressions of Akt and p-Akt proteins were determined with Western blotting. RESULTS: The p-Akt-positive cell and p-Akt protein expression increased significantly while the caspase-9-positive cell and caspase-9 mRNA expression decreased in rHuEPO group as compared with those in PTZ group (P<0.05). LY294002 treatment prior to rHuEPO injection significantly abolished the effects of rHuEPO on caspase-9 and p-Akt immunohistochemical positivity and caspase-9 mRNA and p-Akt protein expressions (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Administration of rHuEPO activates the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in SE rats and increases the expression of p-Akt protein to regulate the expression of caspase-9, a regulatory factor of the mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway, and therefore provides anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective effects.
