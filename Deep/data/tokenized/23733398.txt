Homer1a (H1a) is an immediate early gene involved in multiple forms of synaptic plasticity. It exhibits a postnatal increase in the rat forebrain (Brakeman et al. (1997) Nature 386:284-288) and reduces the density and size of dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons (Sala et al. (2003) J Neurosci 23:6327-6337). We evaluated hippocampal H1a expression at different postnatal ages (P3, P5, P7, P9, P15, P19, P23, P35, and adult) using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) and qRT-PCR. Maximal electroconvulsive shock (MECS) was used to induce maximal expression relative to home cage (HC) controls. Large scale images and confocal z-stacks from dorsal subiculum (DS), CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG) were analyzed by both manual and automated methods. In DS, CA1, and CA3 a significant proportion of cells (40%) expressed small but detectable levels of H1a from P3; however, MECS did not up-regulate H1a during the first postnatal week. MECS induced H1a positive cells during the second postnatal week and induction reached adult levels at P9. H1a-Intra Nuclear Foci (INF) size and intensity varied with age, increasing at P19-23 in CA1 and CA3 and from P9 to P23 in DS. In DG, H1a expression exhibited a lamination pattern and an H1a-INF size and intensity gradient across the granule cell layer, consistent with the outside-in maturation of DG granule cells. The developmental progression of H1a corresponds to the synaptic refinement period supporting the conclusion that H1a could play an important role in this process.
