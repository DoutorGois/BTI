Modulation of hippocampal CA3-CA1 synaptic transmission during metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) activation was investigated in juvenile (postnatal day (P) 15-21) and young adult rats (P28-35). The mGluR agonist 1S,3R-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (ACPD) depressed the EPSP slope more in young adults than juveniles. ACPD increased paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) at both ages. The group I mGluR antagonist (+)-alpha-methylcarboxyphenylglycine (MCPG) inhibited the ACPD-mediated depression of the EPSP slope and completely blocked the increase in PPF only in young adults. Minimal effects of MCPG on ACPD-dependent synaptic depression were observed in juveniles. These data suggest that presynaptic group I mGluR-mediated synaptic inhibition increases across late postnatal development. In addition, other mGluR subtypes, with the ability to depress presynaptic function, appear to be present in juveniles.
