Neurofibrillary tangle (NFT)-rich brain samples from patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) were probed with a large panel of anti-tau antibodies to compare the species of tau present in PSP and AD NFTs by immunohistochemistry and Western blot methods. These antibodies have been shown to recognize phosphate-independent or -dependent epitopes that extend from the amino to the carboxy terminal domains of normal brain tau and the abnormal tau in the paired helical filaments (PHFs) of AD NFTs (PHFtau). The immunohistochemical studies showed that all of the tau epitopes detected in brainstem PSP NFTs also were found in hippocampal AD NFTs and vice versa. While Western blots demonstrated 2 PHFtau-like immunobands in PSP brainstem, a triplet of PHFtau proteins were seen in the AD and PSP hippocampus. Despite differences in the distribution, ultrastructure and immunoblot profile of NFTs in PSP and AD, the same constellation of tau epitopes is present in the abnormal tau proteins in PSP and AD NFTs. Thus, the generation of abnormal tau proteins in PSP (PSPtau) and AD (PHFtau) may have similar adverse biological consequences in both diseases.
