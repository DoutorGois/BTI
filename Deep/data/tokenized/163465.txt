Multiple unit activity (MUA) of brain stem, hypothalamic and limbic structures was studied during habituation to a novel environment and circadian rhythm in chronically implanted freely moving rats. MUA was analysed in the mesencephalic reticular formation (MRF), area hypothalami posterior (PH), basal nuclear group of amygdala (AMY), area septalis (SEPT), dorsal hippocampus (HIPP) and area hypothalami anterior (AH). It was found that in the novel environment MUA of all subcortical structures increased to a high level. During habituation MUA in each phase of wakefulness--sleep cycle decreased to stable low level both in brain stem and forebrain structures. Gradual decrease in MUA was characteristic to MRF, and a sharp decrease occured in AH and AMY. The environmental habituation proved to be a long lasting process in rat. During all phases of wakefulness--sleep cycle activity was significantly higher in the light period than in the dark, and MUA base level showed circadian variation both in brainstem and limbic structures. Close correlation was found between the actual MUA level and responsiveness to various sensory modalities both during habituation and circadian rhythm. The higher the MUA level, the higher the responsiveness, and a fall in activity was accompanied by decreased neuronal responsiveness.
