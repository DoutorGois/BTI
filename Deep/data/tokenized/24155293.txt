The ventral tegmental area (VTA) has been implicated in a number of psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder. One major regulator of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system is the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which makes direct and indirect connections to the hippocampus and amygdala, as well as directly to the VTA. The mPFC is comprised of two subregions: the infralimbic and prelimbic cortices (ilPFC and plPFC). However, the specific roles of these subregions in regulating VTA dopamine activity have remained unclear. In this study, we aim to clarify this role and to examine the divergent neuranatomical circuits by which the mPFC regulates VTA activity. Using in vivo extracellular recordings in rats, we tested the effects of pharmacological activation (with NMDA) and inactivation (with TTX) of the ilPFC and plPFC on dopamine neuron activity, and tested the roles of the ventral subiculum (vSub) and basolateral amygdala in this process. We found that the ilPFC exerts a bidirectional control of VTA dopamine neurons, which are differentially modulated through the vSub and the basolateral amygdala. Specifically, activation or inactivation of the ilPFC attenuated or activated dopamine neuron population activity, respectively. Furthermore, dopamine activation depended on the ventral hippocampus and inactivation on the amygdala. In contrast, only inactivation of the plPFC altered dopamine neuron activity. These data indicate that the mPFC has the ability to uniquely fine-tune dopaminergic activity in the VTA. Furthermore, the data presented here suggest that the ilPFC may have a role in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders.
