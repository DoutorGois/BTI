Our previous studies demonstrated coordinate expression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) -B chain and beta-receptor in neurons at risk in the rat brain with focal ischemia. To clarify a role of the -B chain in the brain further, we examined whether PDGF-A or -B chain protects CA1 pyramidal neurons from delayed neuronal death after forebrain ischemia in rats. Pretreatment with PDGF-BB, but not -AA, at 120 ng/d for 2 days until forebrain ischemia was performed markedly ameliorated delayed neuronal death in CA1 pyramidal neurons on day 7 after ischemia. This neuroprotective effect of PDGF-BB was dose-dependent, and pretreatment with PDGF-BB at 240 ng/d showed almost complete inhibition of delayed neuronal death. In contrast, posttreatment with PDGF-BB at 120 ng/d starting 20 minutes after ischemia demonstrated no significant neuroprotective effect. The current study established marked neuroprotective actions of PDGF-BB in ischemic neuronal damage.
