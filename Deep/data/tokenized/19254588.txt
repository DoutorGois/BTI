OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that pretreatment with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a potentially neuroprotective polyunsaturated fatty acid, would improve function and reduce brain damage in a rat model of perinatal hypoxia-ischemia. STUDY DESIGN: Seven-day-old rats were divided into 3 treatment groups that received intraperitoneal injections of DHA 1, 2.5, or 5 mg/kg as DHA-albumin complex and 3 controls that received 25% albumin, saline, or no injection. Subsequently, rats underwent right carotid ligation followed by 90 minutes of 8% oxygen. Rats underwent sensorimotor testing (vibrissae-stimulated forepaw placing) and morphometric assessment of right-sided tissue loss on postnatal day 14. RESULTS: DHA pretreatment improved forepaw placing response to near-normal levels (9.5 +/- 0.9 treatment vs 7.1 +/- 2.2 controls; normal = 10; P < .0001). DHA attenuated hemisphere damage compared with controls (P = .0155), with particular benefit in the hippocampus with 1 mg/kg (38% protection vs albumin controls). CONCLUSION: DHA pretreatment improves functional outcome and reduces volume loss after hypoxia-ischemia in neonatal rats.
