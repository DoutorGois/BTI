The immune system has been implicated in the etiology of schizophrenia. Autoimmunity by antibodies against neuronal cell surface antigens has been proposed as one of the pathological mechanisms. We examined plasma samples of 104 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia for the presence of autoantibodies against neuronal cell surface antigens using cultured hippocampal neurons and transfected HeLa cells. None of the samples tested positive for the presence of these autoantibodies. Based on our results it seems unlikely that autoantibodies against neuronal cell surface antigens play a role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, although further studies using cerebrospinal fluid are needed.
