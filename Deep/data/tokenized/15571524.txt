Cardiac bradyarrhythmias may play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). We describe a patient with left temporal lobe epilepsy in whom high-grade atrioventricular conduction blocks were triggered by both spontaneous and stimulation-induced epileptic activity in the left temporal lobe. Electrophysiological data obtained by surface and intracranial electrodes point to a cerebral cardioarrhythmogenesis in the left amygdala and anterior hippocampus.
