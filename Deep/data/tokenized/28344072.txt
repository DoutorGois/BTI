Osteopontin (OPN), an extracellular matrix (ECM) glyco-phosphoprotein, plays an important role in autoimmune-mediated demyelinating diseases, including multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). As an integrin and CD44 binding protein it participates in bidirectional communication between the ECM and target cells and affects transduction pathways that maintain neuronal and immune cell homeostasis. Its biological activity is also heavily influenced by microenvironment, which stimulates the cleavage of OPN and changes its functions. In this study we estimated the expression profile of OPN in neural tissues of DA rats during the first relapse of chronic relapsing EAE and investigated the relationship of OPN to metallothionein I+II (MTs), which play pivotal role in zinc-related cell homeostasis and in protection of CNS against cytokine-induced injury. The data showed that in EAE rats OPN mRNA and protein levels increased concurrently with the transcription of MTs and that within the spinal cord (SC) lysates EAE-afflicted rats had a higher content of OPN fragments of low molecular weight than untreated and CFA-treated rats. The expression of OPN and MTs was upregulated on ependymal, lymphoid and astroglial cells and on multiple alphavbeta3+ neurons in SC and in the brain (cortex, white matter, hippocampus, and cerebellum). Besides, multiple cells co-expressed OPN and MTs. Granular OPN signals were detected in secretory vesicles of Golgy (alphavbeta3 neurons) and in patches adjacent to the plasma membrane (subventricular zone). The findings imply that in demyelinating lesions are generated proteolytic OPN fragments and that OPN/MT interactions contribute to tissue remodeling during an autoimmune attack.
