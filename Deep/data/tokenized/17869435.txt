Diabetic encephalopathy is a recognized complication of untreated diabetes resulting in a progressive cognitive impairment accompanied by modification of hippocampal function. The purinergic system is a promising novel target to control diabetic encephalopathy since it might simultaneously control hippocampal synaptic plasticity and glucose handling. We now tested whether streptozotocin-induced diabetes led to a modification of extracellular ATP homeostasis and density of membrane ATP (P2) receptors in the hippocampus, a brain structure involved in learning and memory. The extracellular levels of ATP, evaluated in the cerebrospinal fluid, were reduced by 60.4+/-17.0% in diabetic rats. Likewise, the evoked release of ATP as well as its extracellular catabolism was also decreased in hippocampal nerve terminals of diabetic rats by 52.8+/-10.9% and 38.7+/-6.5%, respectively. Western blot analysis showed that the density of several P2 receptors (P2X(3,5,7) and P2Y(2,6,11)) was decreased in hippocampal nerve terminals. This indicates that the synaptic ATP signaling is globally depressed in diabetic rats, which may contribute for diabetes-associated decrease of synaptic plasticity. In contrast, the density of P2 receptors (P2X(1,2,5,6,7) and P2Y(6) but not P2Y(2)) increased in whole hippocampal membranes, suggesting an adaptation of non-synaptic P2 receptors to sense decreased levels of extracellular ATP in diabetic rats, which might be aimed at preserving the non-synaptic purinergic signaling.
