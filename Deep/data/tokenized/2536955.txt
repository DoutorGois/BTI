Calcium channels mediate the generation of action potentials, pacemaking, excitation-contraction coupling, and secretion and signal integration in muscle, secretory, and neuronal cells. The physiological regulation of the L-type calcium channel is thought to be mediated primarily by guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins). A low molecular weight endogenous peptide has been isolated and purified from rat brain. This peptide regulates up and down the cardiac and neuronal calcium channels, respectively. In cardiac myocytes, the peptide-induced enhancement of the L-type calcium current had a slow onset (half-time approximately 75 seconds), occurred via a G protein-independent mechanism, and could not be inhibited by alpha 1-adrenergic, beta-adrenergic, or angiotensin II blockers. In neuronal cells, on the other hand, the negative effect had a rapid onset (half-time less than 500 milliseconds) and was observed on both T-type and L-type calcium channels.
