CA1 neurons in the hippocampus, a brain structure involved in learning and memory, are selectively vulnerable to ischemic effects. In this study, the authors examined if duration of ischemia is directly related to extent of CA1 damage and degree of spatial learning deficit. Adult female Wistar rats received either 5-min or 10-min ischemia or sham surgery. Following recovery, rats were tested in the Morris water maze. Histological analysis showed moderate cell loss in CA1 (31%) and CA3 (12%) and minimal cell loss in CA2 (4%) with 5-min ischemia. Increased cell loss was seen in CA1 (68%), CA2 (16%), and CA3 (23%) with 10-min ischemia. Behavioral testing revealed that animals with 10-min ischemia have greater spatial learning deficits and they remain impaired across the test days compared to the 5-min ischemic group. Furthermore, degree of CA1 cell loss accounted for approximately 45% of the variance in spatial learning deficits in the ischemic group. The authors conclude that cell loss is largely confined to CA1 region in rats who received 5 and 10 min of ischemia and that increased ischemic duration results in persistent learning deficits in female rats; also, the degree of behavioral impairment is related to extent of CA1 cell loss.
