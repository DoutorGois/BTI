Effects of DSP-4 on noradrenaline (NA), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl glycol (MHPG), serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) levels and on beta adrenoceptor binding kinetics (Bmax and KD) in rat hippocampus, cortex and hypothalamus were studied between 24 hours and 14 days after systemic administration. Beta adrenoceptor numbers in hippocampus and cortex, but not in hypothalamus, were significantly increased after DSP-4. No significant changes in KD values were observed in hypothalamus, but significant increases in this parameter were measured in hippocampus and cortex. NA and MHPG levels were significantly decreased in all three brain regions, but MHPG/NA ratios were increased in hippocampus, decreased in cortex and unchanged in hypothalamus. Very prominent increases in 5-HIAA levels were observed in all three brain regions, but only at one day after DSP-4. The greatest increases in 5-HIAA levels occurred in the hippocampus, but this effect of DSP-4 appeared to be slightly diminished by pre-treatment with fluoxetine. In cortex and hippocampus 5-HT levels were slightly, but significantly decreased after DSP-4.
