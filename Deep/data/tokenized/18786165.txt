The oligodendrogenic program of progenitor cells in the adult CNS follows a sequential process of progenitor proliferation, fate choice, determination, differentiation, maturation and survival. Previously, we described a soluble activity derived from mesenchymal stem cells that induces oligodendrogenesis in adult neural progenitor cells. Here, we hypothesized that ciliary neurotrophic factor might be a candidate for this activity, since (i) it is expressed by mesenchymal stem cells and (ii) it can promote oligodendrogenesis during development. Along the course of the study, we found differential effects by ciliary neurotrophic factor and by the mesenchymal stem cells-derived activity on neural progenitors. While the mesenchymal stem cells-derived activity induced oligodendrogenesis at the expense of astrogenesis and promoted oligodendroglial differentiation/maturation, the effect of ciliary neurotrophic factor was restricted to the latter one. This was reflected at the levels of the cell fate determinants Olig1, Olig2, Id2, and the oligodendroglia-maturation transcription factor GTX/Nkx6.2. Finally, experiments using blocking antibodies excluded ciliary neurotrophic factor to be the mesenchymal stem cell-derived oligodendroglial activity. In summary, this work provides evidence for differential effects of ciliary neurotrophic factor and mesenchymal stem cells-derived activity on oligodendrogenesis of adult neural progenitor cells.
