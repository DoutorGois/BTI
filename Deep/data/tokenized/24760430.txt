Tanshinone I (TsI) is an important lipophilic diterpene extracted from Danshen (Radix Salvia miltiorrhizae) and has been used in Asia for the treatment of cerebrovascular diseases such as ischemic stroke. In this study, we examined the neuroprotective effect of TsI against ischemic damage and its neuroprotective mechanism in the gerbil hippocampal CA1 region (CA1) induced by 5 min of transient global cerebral ischemia. Pre-treatment with TsI protected pyramidal neurons from ischemic damage in the stratum pyramidale (SP) of the CA1 after ischemia-reperfusion. The pre-treatment with TsI increased the immunoreactivities and protein levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13] in the TsI-treated-sham-operated-groups compared with those in the vehicle-treated-sham-operated-groups; however, the treatment did not increase the immunoreactivities and protein levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-2 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha). On the other hand, in the TsI-treated-ischemia-operated-groups, the immunoreactivities and protein levels of all the cytokines were maintained in the SP of the CA1 after transient cerebral ischemia. In addition, we examined that IL-4 injection into the lateral ventricle did not protect pyramidal neurons from ischemic damage. In conclusion, these findings indicate that the pre-treatment with TsI can protect against ischemia-induced neuronal death in the CA1 via the increase or maintenance of endogenous inflammatory cytokines, and exogenous IL-4 does not protect against ischemic damage.
