In the human hippocampus, the density of glutamate and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) binding sites follows during development a bell-shaped curve with a peak at 23-27 fetal weeks. We suggest that there is a transient increased density of NMDA binding sites during a restricted period of hippocampal development; this may play an important role in developmental plasticity.
