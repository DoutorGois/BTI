Using o-phospho-L-tyrosine as substrate, a possible localization of phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase (PTPPase) activity was histochemically demonstrated in the rat hippocampal formation. The PTPPase activity was found in almost all layers of the hippocampal formation, with a high activity in the stratum moleculare. The activity was inhibited by vanadate and molybdate, but not by NaF and Zn2+. The activity was localized in the dendritic cytoplasm, particularly on the postsynaptic density, of hippocampal neurons.
