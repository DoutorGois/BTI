Glutamate and GABA are major synaptic neurotransmitters in the hippocampus. However, their action is not confined to restricted postsynaptic area. A number of sources, such as reversed uptake, glial exocytosis, osmotically driven release, and neurotransmitter spillover can build up the extracellular concentration of these amino acids. GABA and glutamate receptors can be found at various glial and neuronal compartments. Subcellular distribution, subunit composition, and metabotropic/ionotropic nature of these receptors will determine an effect of their activation. This review surveys general principles for diffuse glutamate- and GABA-mediated extrasynaptic neurotransmission, interaction between synaptic and extrasynaptic signaling and between diffuse neurotransmitters themselves.
