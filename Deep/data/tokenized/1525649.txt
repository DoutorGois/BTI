The immunohistochemical localization of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was studied in the adult rat brain, using a specific antibody against a synthetic bFGF fragment (the N-terminal 12 residues). Widespread but uneven regional localization of bFGF-like immunoreactive neurons and fibers was observed. Ependymal cells were also stained. The immunoreactive neurons were found in the cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb, septum, basal magnocellular nuclei, thalamus, hypothalamus, globus pallidus, hippocampus, amygdala, red nucleus, central gray of the midbrain, cerebellum, dorsal tegmental area, reticular formation, cranial motor nuclei and spinal cord. Immunoreactive fiber bundles and nerve terminals were also detected. These results indicate that bFGF is produced by or present in a specific neuronal cell population of the central nervous system.
