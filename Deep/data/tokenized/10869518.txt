We have investigated the regional difference of neuronal vulnerability within the hippocampus in the C57BL/6 strain mice after forebrain ischemia. Both common carotid arteries of fifty mice were occluded for 12 min and the mouse brain was examined with cresyl violet staining. The CA4 sector was found to be the most vulnerable within the hippocampus. The CA2 and the medial CA1 sector was the 2nd and 3rd most vulnerable regions. However, The lateral part of the CA1 sector, CA3 sector and the dentate gyrus were resistant to ischemic insult.
