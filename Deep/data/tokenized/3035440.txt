Noradrenaline enhanced in a concentration-dependent way the basal release of endogenous GABA from superfused rat hippocampus synaptosomes. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine prevented the releasing effect of noradrenaline while the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin was ineffective. It is concluded that GABAergic nerve terminals in rat hippocampus possess adrenoceptors of the alpha 2-subtype whose activation causes enhancement of GABA release.
