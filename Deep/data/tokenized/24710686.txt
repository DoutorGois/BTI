Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it is obscure how amyloid-beta (Abeta) can impair mitochondria in the early stage of AD pathology. Using PrP-hAPP/hPS1 double-transgenic AD mouse model, we find that abnormal mitochondrial morphology and damaged mitochondrial structure in hippocampal neurons appear in the early stage of AD-like disease development. We also find consistent mitochondrial abnormalities in the SH-SY5Y cells, which express amyloid precursor protein (APP) Swedish mutation (APPsw) and have been used as a cell model of the early-onset AD. Significant changes of mitofusin GTPases (Mfn1 and Mfn2) were detected both in the PrP-hAPP/hPS1 brains and SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, our results show that Abeta accumulation in neurons of PrP-hAPP/hPS1 mice can affect the neurogenesis prior to plaque formation. These findings suggest that mitochondrial impairment is a very early event in AD pathogenesis and abnormal expression of Mfn1 and Mfn2 caused by excessive intracellular Abeta is the possible molecular mechanism. Interestingly, L-theanine has significant effects on regulating mitochondrial fusion proteins in SH-SY5Y (APPsw) cells. Overall, our results not only suggest a new early mechanism of AD pathogenesis but also propose a preventive candidate, L-theanine, for the treatment of AD.
