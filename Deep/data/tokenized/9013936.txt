Many peptides modulating cellular growth and differentiation in development are first synthesized as precursors that require proteolytic processing by the "prohormone convertase" (PC) family of endoproteases. Using in situ hybridization, we have here determined that two recently identified PC members, PC5 and PACE4, are expressed prenatally in spatial and temporal patterns that are each unique and distinct from those of previously characterized PCs. PC5 mRNA is first detected at e9 in highly restricted regions of the neural tube, in caudal myotomes, and at the materno-embryonic junction of the uterus. At e10, restricted PC5 mRNA expression is detected in the optic and otic vesicles, the roof of midbrain, and trunk myotomes. By midgestation (e13-e16), PC5 mRNA expression in the developing nervous system has expanded to multiple regions including hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, brain stem, and spinal cord. By midgestational stages, PACE4 mRNA is expressed in multiple regions of the developing nervous system, generally distinct from PC5, and including a uniquely high level of expression in the ventricular zone of the hippocampus. In several peripheral organ systems, including lung and gut, we observed remarkably complementary patterns of PC5 and PACE4 expression. In addition, PACE4 transcripts are expressed in the heart and liver, whereas PC5 is expressed in the adrenal and kidney primordia. These results suggest that both PC5 and PACE4 may be involved in neuropeptide precursor processing in the developing nervous system and peripheral tissues with the general nonoverlapping expression patterns suggesting that PC5 and PACE4 may process distinct sets of proprotein substrates.
