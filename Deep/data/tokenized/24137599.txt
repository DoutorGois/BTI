Dimeric dipeptide GSB-106, a novel structural analogue of neurotrophin BDNF, in doses from 10(-5) to 10(-8) M protected cultured immortalized mouse hippocampal HT-22 neurons from H2O2 or glutamate damage. The neuroprotective effect of GSB-106 was also shown on cultured SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells after treatment with neurotoxin 6-hydroxidopamine. These data attest to functional similarity of GSB-106 and neurotrophin BDNF.
