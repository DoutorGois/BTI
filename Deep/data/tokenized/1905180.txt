The localization of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase in monkey brain was investigated by the immunoperoxidase method using the monoclonal antibody (PES-7) raised against the enzyme purified from bovine seminal vesicle. The frozen sections with 30-microns thickness were employed after the brain was fixed with perfusion of 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. The immunoreactivity was most intense in the neurons of cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and was moderate in the neurons of caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus and amygdala, while it was relatively weak in glial cells in the whole brain regions including the white matter. The majority of neurons showed the immunoreactivity in the somata and proximal dendrites, but exceptionally in the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, positive staining was also observed in the apical dendrites. In the cerebellum, the immunoreactivity in both neurons and glia was rather faint as compared with that in other regions. Positive staining was not significantly observed in the vasculatures and arachnoid membranes. These findings indicate that most of neuronal and glial cells in monkey brain contain the enzyme of the rate-limiting and initial step of the biosynthesis of prostaglandins which regulate a variety of neural functions.
