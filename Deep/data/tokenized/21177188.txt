OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of intracerebroventricular injection of rAAV-HIF-1alpha on hippocampal neuronal apoptosis in a rat model of Alzheimer disease (AD). METHODS: Thirty-two male SD rats (250-300 g) were randomized into 4 groups (n=8), including the normal control group without any treatment, AD model group with right intracerebroventricular injection of 2 microl Abeta25-35 (10 mg/m1), sham-operated group with right intracerebroventricular injection of 2 microl normal saline, and AD+ rAAV-HIF-1alpha group with right intracerebroventricular injection of 10 microl rAAV-HIF-1a (1x10(1)(2) v.g./m1) one week after Abeta25-35 injection. The rats were sacrificed to detect the expression of HIF-1alpha and apoptosis of hippocampal neurons 5 weeks after Abeta25-35 or saline injection. RESULTS: Western blotting showed that the expression of HIF-1alpha was significantly higher in AD+rAAV-HIF-1alpha group (451.59+/-34.39) than in normal control group (229.05+/-41.28) and sham-operated group (216.29+/-37.08) (P<0.05) without significant difference between the latter two groups. The apoptotic ratio of the hippocampal neurons was significantly higher in AD model group ([19.49+/-2.59]%) than in normal control group ([5.41+/-0.75]%) and sham-operated group ([5.28+/-0.66]%) in (P<0.05), and intracerebroventricular injection of rAAV-HIF-1alpha resulted in a significant reduction of the apoptotic ratio in the AD rats ([12.07+/-2.06]%) (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Intracerebroventricular injection of rAAV-HIF-1alpha can inhibit hippocampal neuronal apoptosis in the rat model of AD.
