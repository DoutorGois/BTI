Nowadays it is widely recognized that D-amino acids are present in bacteria as well as in eukaryotes, including mammals. In particular, free D-serine and D-aspartate are found in the brain of mammals. Notably, D-aspartate occurs at substantial levels in the embryo brain to then consistently decrease at post-natal phases. Temporal regulation of D-aspartate content depends on the post-natal onset of D-aspartate oxidase expression, the only known enzyme able to catabolize this D-amino acid. Pharmacological evidence indicates that D-aspartate binds and activates NMDA receptors (NMDARs). To decipher the physiological function of D-aspartate in mammals, in the last years, genetic and pharmacological mouse models with abnormally higher levels of this D-amino acid have been generated. Overall, these animal models have pointed out a significant neuromodulatory role for D-aspartate in the regulation of NMDAR-dependent functions. Indeed, increased content of D-aspartate are able to increase hippocampal NMDAR-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) and spatial memory of adult mice. However, if exposure to elevated levels of D-Asp lasts for the entire lifetime of mice, enhancement of synaptic plasticity turns into a dramatic worsening, thus triggering an acceleration of the NMDAR-dependent aging processes in the hippocampus. Nonetheless, administration of D-Asp to old mice can restore the physiological age-related decay of hippocampal NMDA-related LTP. Besides its effect on hippocampus-dependent processes in mouse models, different points of evidence are indicating, today, a potential role for D-Asp in neurologic and psychiatric disorders associated with aberrant signalling of NMDARs.
