The silver staining of the nucleolar organizer regions (Ag-NORs) was used in order to estimate the biosynthetic activity of three hippocampal areas (dentate gyrus, CA1 and CA3) during postnatal development and ageing. 32 Wistar rats were used and 4 groups were formed according to the age of the animals (14, 21, 90 days and 23 months). Several Ag-NOR parameters such as mean Ag-NOR area and the ratio between Ag-NOR and nuclear areas per neuronal cell were quantified using an image analysis system. High values of these parameters are associated with a high rate of rRNA transcription. In this way, the neural biosynthetic activity in all regions studied decreased as the older ages are reached. Differences between areas are shown with the dentate gyrus and CA1 areas decreasing faster. The different activity among these areas is discussed, taking into account the particular affect on these areas of some injuries and the ageing process. Our results support the hypothesis of NOR loss as a main cause of ageing as reported by other authors.
