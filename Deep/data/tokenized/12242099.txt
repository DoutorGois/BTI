The effects of perinatal exposure to lead (300 mg/l) on the development of monoaminergic and aminoacidergic systems were evaluated in the striatum, cerebral cortex (Cx), dorsal hippocampus (d-Hipp) and basal-medial hypothalamus. Maternal exposure to lead produced regional alterations in monoamine content, with increases in dopamine and serotonin or their metabolites. Further, decreased glutamate levels were seen in all brain regions studied, while GABA content decreased only in the Cx. Together, these results show that lead causes alterations to neurotransmitter systems during development. These may be related to lead-induced neurobehavioral impairment.
