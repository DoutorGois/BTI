We have studied the effect of ultracaine DS forte on local blood flow of the rat gum as well as on the development of the convulsion activity of the brain at systemic injection. Experiments were carried out on 12 mongrel albino mail rats of 200-250 g weight. In the I group of animals under the light chloral hydrate anesthesia we studied the changes of local blood flow in the rat gum of lower jaw after ultracaine DS forte injection (right side) and the similar quantity of phisiological solution (left side). According to our data, in the right gum, the rate of local blood flow decreases statistically significantly at 18%, while the injection of physiological solution did not result in any changes. In the II group, experiments were carried out on the animals with bipolar electrodes in neocortex, as well as in the right and the left dorsal hippocampus. On the fifth day after surgical intervention, on the background of registration of electric activity of the above stated structures 0,03-0,04 ml of ultracaine Ds forte was injected intraperitoneally, which did not result in any significant deviation on the encephalogram. 10-fold doze injection was followed by abortion of epileptic discharges (0,3 ml), but repeated injection of 0,3 ml of preparation resulted in generalized clone-tonus type seizure activity. Simultaneously, clone-tonus type behavioral manifestation was revealed.
