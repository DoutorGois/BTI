Prior mechanical brain microinjury has been found to have a preventive effect on brain ischemia. To investigate the mechanism responsible for this, the effect of mechanical brain injury on changes in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in response to ischemic insult was studied in mouse hippocampal slices. The mechanical injury was made by inserting a 25G hypodermic needle into the CA1 region of the hippocampus in mice anesthetized with pentobarbital. Sagittal slices of the hippocampus were prepared two hours, and 1, 3, 7, and 14 days after the brain injury. Changes in [Ca2+]i in the slices by oxygen-glucose deprivation were analyzed from fluorescence images, using fura-2. Increases in [Ca2+]i induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation were inhibited in the vicinity of the injury 1 and 3 days after injury. [Ca2+]i levels were lower in the posterior side from the injury than in the anterior side 1 and 3 days after injury. No significant regional differences in [Ca2+]i responses were found 2 h or 7 and 14 days after the injury. Membrane potential and membrane resistance of CA1 neurons in the vicinity of the injury measured 1 day after the injury were not significantly altered in comparison with non-injured slices. These results indicate that mechanical brain injury inhibits ischemic [Ca2+]i increase. This inhibition may be induced not only by damage of the presynaptic fibers projecting to the CA1 neurons but also by the other certain factor(s) that prevent [Ca2+]i increase, and it appears to be related to the protective effect of prior mechanical injury against ischemic neuronal damage.
