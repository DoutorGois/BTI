We aimed to study the influences of active epilepsy and intellectual disability (ID) on the serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) by determining levels in 74 patients with developmental disorder with epilepsy and 63 healthy controls. The patients showed significantly higher IL-6 levels than the controls (4.1+/-4.5pg/ml vs. 2.1+/-1.0pg/ml; p<0.001). High seizure frequency and severe intellectual disability emerged as predictors for elevated serum levels of IL-6.
