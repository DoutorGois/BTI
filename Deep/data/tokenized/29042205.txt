Pro-inflammatory cytokine exposure in early postnatal life triggers clear neurotoxic effects on the developing hippocampus. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is one of the inflammatory mediators and is a potent inhibitor of neurogenesis. Memantine (MEM) is an uncompetitive N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been demonstrated to increase the proliferation of hippocampal progenitor cells. However, the effects of MEM on TNF-alpha-mediated impairment of hippocampal precursor proliferation remain unclear. In this study, mice were exposed to TNF-alpha and later treated with MEM to evaluate its protective effects on TNF-alpha-mediated toxicity during hippocampal development. The results indicated that brief exposure to TNF-alpha on postnatal days 3 and 5 resulted in a significant impairment of hippocampal precursor proliferation and a depletion of hippocampal neural precursor cells (NPCs). This effect was attenuated by MEM treatment. We further confirmed that MEM treatment reversed the TNF-alpha-induced microglia activation and up-regulation of hippocampal NF-kappaB, MCP-1 and IL-6 mRNA levels, which may be related to the proliferation and maintenance of NPCs. Overall, our results suggest that MEM treatment protects against TNF-alpha-induced repression of hippocampal precursor proliferation in postnatal mice by partially attenuating neuroinflammatory responses.
