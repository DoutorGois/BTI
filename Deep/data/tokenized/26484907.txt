The amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) has long been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using J20 mice, which express human AbetaPP with Swedish and Indiana mutations, we studied early pathological changes in the olfactory bulb. The presence of AbetaPP/amyloid-beta (Abeta) was examined in mice aged 3 months (before the onset of hippocampal Abeta deposition) and over 5 months (when hippocampal Abeta deposits are present). The number of neurons, non-neurons, and proliferating cells was assessed using the isotropic fractionator method. Our results demonstrate that although AbetaPP is overexpressed in some of the mitral cells, widespread Abeta deposition and microglia aggregates are not prevalent in the olfactory bulb. The olfactory bulbs of the younger J20 group harbored significantly fewer neurons than those of the age-matched wild-type mice (5.57+/-0.13 million versus 6.59+/-0.36 million neurons; p = 0.011). In contrast, the number of proliferating cells was higher in the young J20 than in the wild-type group (i.e., 6617+/-425 versus 4455+/-623 cells; p = 0.011). A significant increase in neurogenic activity was also observed in the younger J20 olfactory bulb. In conclusion, our results indicate that (1) neurons participating in the mouse olfactory function overexpress AbetaPP; (2) the cellular composition of the young J20 olfactory bulb is different from that of wild-type littermates; (3) these differences may reflect altered neurogenic activity and/or delayed development of the J20 olfactory system; and (4) AbetaPP/Abeta-associated pathological changes that take place in the J20 hippocampus and olfactory bulb are not identical.
