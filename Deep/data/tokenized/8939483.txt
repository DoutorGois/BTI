A moderate increase in plasma level of corticosterone was induced in dams by adding the hormone (200 micrograms/ml) to the drinking water from the day after delivery to weaning. This procedure produces a parallel increase in plasma levels of the hormone in the pups (from 0.7 +/- 0.1 to 1.2 +/- 0.2 micrograms/100 ml) at 10 days of lactation. A significant (P < 0.01) reduction in the magnitude of the long-term potentiation (LTP) of the CA1 population spike occurred in hippocampal slices obtained from 30-45 day old male corticosterone-nursed rats with respect to controls, while no significant difference occurred in the magnitude of the basal CA1 evoked extracellular somatic field potentials with respect to controls. The results demonstrate that a moderate increase in plasma corticosterone during neonatal life, obtained through maternal milk, has long-lasting effects on the hippocampal CA1 synaptic plasticity. In addition, these results together with our previous findings [Catalani, A. et al., Brain Res., 624 (1993) 209-215], demonstrating that 30 day old corticosterone-nursed offsprings perform better than controls in the place learning version of the Morris water maze, show no relationships between in vitro CA1 LTP induction and spatial learning in agreement with literature data.
