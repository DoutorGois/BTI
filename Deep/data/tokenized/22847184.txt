Tyrosinemia is a rare disease caused by a single mutation to the gene that code for the enzyme responsible for tyrosine catabolism. Because the mechanisms underlying the neurological dysfunction in hypertyrosinemic patients are poorly understood, we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo effect of L-tyrosine on the activities of the enzymes citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase and complexes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in the brains and livers of young rats. Thirty-day-old Wistar rats were killed by decapitation, and the brains and livers were harvested. L-Tyrosine (0.1, 1.0, 2.0 or 4.0 mM) was added to the reaction medium. For in vivo studies, Wistar rats were killed 1 h after a single intraperitoneal injection of either tyrosine (500 mg/kg) or saline. The activities of energy metabolism enzymes were evaluated. In this research, we demonstrated in vitro that L-tyrosine inhibited citrate synthase activity in the posterior cortex and that succinate dehydrogenase was increased in the posterior cortex, hippocampus, striatum and liver. The complex I activity was only inhibited in the hippocampus, whereas complex II activity was inhibited in the hippocampus, cortex and liver. Complex IV activity decreased in the posterior cortex. The acute administration of L-tyrosine inhibited enzyme malate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase and complexes II, II-III and IV in the posterior cortex and liver. The enzyme succinate dehydrogenase and complex I activity were inhibited in the posterior cortex and increased in the striatum. These results suggest impairment in energy metabolism that is likely mediated by oxidative stress.
