In ISIAH rat strain with stress-sensitive form of hypertension, the expression level of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene has been evaluated in hippocampus, hypothalamus and pituitary under basal and 2-hr restraint stress conditions. Corticosterone (CS) level in peripheral blood was also evaluated. Normotensive WAG strain was used as a control. Under basal condition, there were no interstrain differences in GR-mRNA level in any brain region under study. However, under stress condition, ISIAH rats demonstrated a significant fall of GR-mRNA in hippocampus and increase the pituitary gland as compared to basal level. On the contrary, no differences with basal level were found in stressed WAG rats. CS concentration in blood was nearly the same in nonstressed WAG and ISIAH rats. Stress influence led to a marked increase of CS in both strains. However CS level was significantly higher in stressed ISIAH rats than in stressed WAG group.
