The aim of the present paper was to examine, in a comparative way, the occurrence and the mechanisms of the interactions between adenosine A(2A) receptors (A(2A)Rs) and metabotropic glutamate 5 receptors (mGlu5Rs) in the hippocampus and the striatum. In rat hippocampal and corticostriatal slices, combined ineffective doses of the mGlu5R agonist 2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine (CHPG) and the A(2A)R agonist CGS 21680 synergistically reduced the slope of excitatory postsynaptic field potentials (fEPSPs) recorded in CA1 and the amplitude of field potentials (FPs) recorded in the dorsomedial striatum. The cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway appeared to be involved in the effects of CGS 21680 in corticostriatal but not in hippocampal slices. In both areas, a postsynaptic locus of interaction appeared more likely. N-methyl-D: -aspartate (NMDA) reduced the fEPSP slope and FP amplitude in hippocampal and corticostriatal slices, respectively. Such an effect was significantly potentiated by CHPG in both areas. Interestingly, the A(2A)R antagonist ZM 241385 significantly reduced the NMDA-potentiating effect of CHPG. In primary cultures of rat hippocampal and striatal neurons (ED 17, DIV 14), CHPG significantly potentiated NMDA-induced lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Again, such an effect was prevented by ZM 241385. Our results show that A(2A) and mGlu5 receptors functionally interact both in the hippocampus and in the striatum, even though different mechanisms seem to be involved in the two areas. The ability of A(2A)Rs to control mGlu5R-dependent effects may thus be a general feature of A(2A)Rs in different brain regions (irrespective of their density) and may represent an additional target for the development of therapeutic strategies against neurological disorders.
