Which brain regions are implicated when words are retrieved under divided attention, and what does this tell us about attentional and memory processes needed for retrieval? To address these questions we used fMRI to examine brain regions associated with auditory recognition performed under full and divided attention (DA). We asked young adults to encode words presented auditorily under full attention (FA), and following this, asked them to recognize studied words while in the scanner. Attention was divided at retrieval by asking participants to perform either an animacy task to words, or odd-digit identification task to numbers presented visually, concurrently with the recognition task. Retrieval was disrupted significantly by the word-, but not number-based concurrent task. A corresponding decrease in brain activity was observed in right hippocampus, bilateral parietal cortex, and left precuneus, thus demonstrating, for the first time, involvement of these regions in recognition under DA at retrieval. Increases in activation of left prefrontal cortex (PFC), associated with phonological processing, were observed in the word- compared to number-based DA condition. Results suggest that the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and neo-cortical components of retrieval, believed to form the basis of episodic memory traces, are disrupted when phonological processing regions in left PFC are engaged simultaneously by another task. Results also support a component-process model of retrieval which posits that MTL-mediated retrieval does not compete for general cognitive resources but does compete for specific structural representations.
