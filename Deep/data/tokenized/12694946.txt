Inositolphosphates and phosphatidylinositides are important second messengers. Previously p42(IP4), a protein with high affinity for both Ins(1,3,4,5)P(4) and PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) has been characterized in our laboratory. In the present study mRNA levels of p42(IP4) were quantified during development (ages: 7, 14, 21 days and adult) by means of ribonuclease protection assay in various rat brain regions (cerebellum, cortex, striatum, thalamus, hypothalamus, olfactory bulb, hippocampus and tectum (superior and inferior colliculus)). A high level of p42(IP4) mRNA was detected in the cortex (ca. 1 pg specific RNA per microg of total RNA) which stayed highly independent of the age of the animals. In hippocampus and in the thalamus, p42(IP4) mRNA levels were comparable to those in the cortex in the first and second week postnatally, but decreased to lower levels in the adult brain. In striatum, the mRNA increased, albeit less intensely than in hippocampus and thalamus, until day 21 postnatally, and then decreased in the adult rat brain. Cerebellar p42(IP4) mRNA showed a slow increase within the first 3 weeks postnatally, and remained rather high in the adult brain. The protein expression of p42(IP4), tested within the same samples by Western blot staining, was consistent with mRNA values. For comparison, glutamic acid decarboxylase (isoforms GAD65/GAD67), an enzyme, for which some regional brain specific distribution is already known, was also examined. The mRNA levels of GAD and its developmental regulation clearly differed from that of p42(IP4). In summary, p42(IP4) expressed in several neuronal cell types, did not seem to be restricted to specific developmental stages, but the high absolute expression levels at all developmental stages indicated that p42(IP4) is a protein fundamental for neuronal functioning.
