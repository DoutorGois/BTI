Using antibodies against synaptic protein preparations, we cloned the cDNA of a new Ca2+-binding protein. Its C-terminal portion displays significant similarity with calmodulin and contains two EF-hand motifs. The corresponding mRNA is highly expressed in rat brain, primarily in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum; its expression appears to be restricted to neurons. Transcript levels increase during postnatal development. A recombinant C-terminal protein fragment binds Ca2+ as indicated by a Ca2+-induced mobility shift in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Antisera generated against the bacterial fusion protein recognize a brain-specific protein doublet with apparent molecular masses of 33 and 36 kDa. These data are confirmed by in vitro translation, which generates a single 36-kDa polypeptide, and by the heterologous expression in 293 cells, which yields a 33/36-kDa doublet comparable to that found in brain. On two-dimensional gels, the 33-kDa band separates into a chain of spots plausibly due to differential phosphorylation. This view is supported by in situ phosphorylation studies in hippocampal slices. Most of the immunoreactivity is detectable in cytoskeletal preparations with a further enrichment in the synapse-associated cytomatrix. These biochemical data, together with the ultra-structural localization in dendrites and the postsynaptic density, strongly suggest an association with the somato-dendritic cytoskeleton. Therefore, this novel Ca2+-binding protein was named caldendrin.
