The effects of prenatal X-irradiation (0.3, 0.6, 1.2 or 1.8 Gy) on the hippocampal development were examined at six weeks of age in rats. The laminar structure of the hippocampus was deranged in the rats exposed to 0.6 Gy or more. Pyramidal cells in the CA-3 region were more susceptible than those in the CA-1 region. Aberrant mossy fiber terminals were observed in the stratum oriens of the CA-3 region (infrapyramidal mossy fibers) in rats exposed to 0.3 Gy or more.
