ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Perilla frutescens (Perilla leaf), a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, has been used for centuries to treat various conditions including depression. A previous study of the authors demonstrated that essential oil of Perilla frutescens (EOPF) attenuated the depressive-like behavior in mice. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study was undertaken to explore the dynamic change of behaviors and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), and improved by EOPF. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four separate CUMS experimental groups (1-week, 2-week, 3-week and 4-week treatment) were treated with EOPF (3 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg, p.o.) or fluoxetine (20 mg/kg, p.o.), followed by sucrose preference, locomotor activity, immobility and hippocampal BDNF measurement. RESULTS: EOPF, as well as fluoxetine, restored the CUMS-induced decreased sucrose preference and increased immobility time, without affecting body weight gain and locomotor activity. Furthermore, CUMS (3 or 4-week) produced a reduction in both BDNF mRNA and protein expression in the hippocampus, which were ameliorated by EOPF (4-week) and fluoxetine (3 or 4-week) treatment. CONCLUSION: These results presented here show that BDNF is expressed depending on length of CUMS procedure and EOPF administration. And this study might contribute to the underlying reason for the slow onset of antidepressant activity in clinic.
