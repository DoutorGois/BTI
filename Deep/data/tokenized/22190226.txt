The accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activates the unfolded protein response (UPR), which involves a set of protein signalling pathways and transcription factors that re-establish homeostasis and normal ER function, adapting cells to ER stress. If this adaptive response is insufficient, the UPR triggers an apoptotic program to eliminate irreversibly damaged cells. Recent observations suggest that ER stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, which is characterized by the deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and hyperphosphorylated tau in susceptible brain regions. Moreover, several studies demonstrate that Abeta induces UPR activation, which in turn promotes tau phosphorylation. In the study by Nijholt and colleagues, reported in the current issue of The Journal of Pathology, the association between UPR activation and tau pathology was investigated in the brain of patients diagnosed with sporadic or familial tauopathies in which Abeta deposits are absent. The authors described that increased levels of UPR activation markers are predominantly observed in neurons within the hippocampus, being correlated with early tau phosphorylation. These findings suggest that UPR activation, which occurs in an Abeta-independent manner, is an early event during tau pathology and point to a functional crosstalk between these molecular mechanisms in tauopathies. A better understanding of UPR activation in tauopathies can thus contribute to the design of new therapeutic strategies with the purpose of promoting neuronal cell survival in these disorders.
