Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1 (Pin1) is a unique PPIase belonging to the parvulin family, and it isomerizes peptide bond between phospho-(Ser/Thr) and Pro. Pin1 has been linked to the pathogenesis of various human diseases; however, its exact biological functions remain unclear. The aim of the present study is to explore the expression pattern of Pin1 in patients with refractory epilepsy and in a chronic pilocarpine-induced epileptic mouse model. Using Western blot, immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation analysis, we found that Pin1 protein was mainly distributed in neurons, demonstrated by colocalization with the dendritic marker, MAP2. However, the expression of Pin1 decreased remarkably in epileptic patients and experimental mice. Furthermore, the reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed that Pin1 interacted with NR2A and NR2B-containing NMDA receptors not AMPA receptors in epileptic mouse models. Our results are the first to indicate that the expression of Pin1 in epileptic brain tissue could play important roles in epilepsy.
