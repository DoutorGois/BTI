Place cells are a fundamental component of the rodent navigational system. One intriguing implication of place cells is that humans, by extension, have "map-like" (or GPS-like) knowledge that we use to represent space. Here, we review both behavioral and neural studies of human navigation, suggesting that how we process visual information forms a critical component of how we represent space. These include cellular and brain systems devoted to coding visual information during navigation in addition to a location coding system similar to that described in rodents. Together, these findings suggest that while it is highly useful to think of our navigation system involving internal "maps," we should not neglect the importance of high-resolution visual representations to how we navigate space.
