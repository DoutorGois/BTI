Dorsal hippocampal lesions increase the amplitude of the circadian rhythms of locomotion and the number of long-period cycles in the structure of forced swimming and simultaneously decrease anxiety in rats. Bilateral destruction of the circadian pacemaker (suprachiasmatic nuclei of hypothalamus) induces the opposite shifts in the rhythmic organization of behavior and anxiety of animals.
