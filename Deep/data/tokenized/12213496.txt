Enterostatin, the N-terminal activation pentapeptide of procolipase that is produced by the pancreas, reduces food intake from high-fat diet when injected either peripherally or centrally to rats. We investigated uptake across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and tissue distribution of enterostatin by giving radioactive-labeled enterostatin (3H-VPDPR) intravenously. Low levels of 3H-VPDPR were detected in many areas of the brain, with greatest radioactivity in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. Radioactivity was found in the plasma and all tissues, with the highest amount detected in the pancreas.
