The brains of three Alzheimer patients aged 93, 94, and 104 years old were analyzed. Although cell death was apparent in different cortices, the prefrontal cortex and the Broca's appeared to be hit hardest. The different CA areas of the hippocampal formation all displayed equivalent degrees of cell death but the entorhinal areas showed the most severe degree of cell degeneration. Both apoptosis and necrosis were observed in the different cerebral regions of these very old patients, as expected.
