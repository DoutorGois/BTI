The effects of levoprotiline (LEV), a (-)-enantiomer of oxaprotiline (OXA) and a clinically effective antidepressant, on the binding parameters of hippocampal 5-HT1A and cortical 5-HT2 receptors of rats were compared with those of (+)-enantiomer of OXA ((+)-OXA), imipramine and mianserin. Both LEV and (+)-OXA displayed in vitro some affinity for 5-HT1A receptors labelled with [3H]-8-OH-DPAT, and for 5-HT2 receptors labelled with [3H]-ketanserin. Repeated administration of LEV, for 14 days led to a marked increase in the number of 5-HT1A binding sites in the rat hippocampus, with no change in the KD values. (+)-OXA, imipramine and mianserin produced similar effects on 5-HT1A binding parameters. The number of 5-HT2 receptors was increased after two weeks of LEV administration, not altered after (+)-OXA, and decreased after imipramine or mianserin. The number of [3H]-ketanserin binding sites was decreased after four weeks of (+)-OXA administration, but not altered after LEV. The specific binding of [3H]-ketanserin in the rat cerebral cortex was decreased after repeated treatment with LEV and (+)-OXA (ex vivo). In competition studies the affinity of serotonin for [3H]-ketanserin binding sites was decreased in LEV- and increased in (+)-OXA-treated rats. The results suggest that LEV similarly to other antidepressants increases the number of 5-HT1A receptors, however without common alteration in 5-HT2 receptor number and function.
