A bidirectional route of communication between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system, termed the "gut-brain axis," is becoming increasingly relevant to treatment of cerebral damage. Panax Notoginsenoside extract (PNE) is popular for prevention and treatment of cardio-cerebrovascular ischemic diseases although plasma and cerebral exposure levels are extremely low. To date, the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of PNE remain largely unknown. In the present study, the neuroprotective effects of PNE were systematically studied via investigation of the regulation by PNE of the gastrointestinal microbial community and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. The results demonstrated that pretreatment with PNE exerted a remarkable neuroprotective effect on focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats, and the efficiency was attenuated in germ-free rats. Pretreatment with PNE could significantly prevent downregulation of Bifidobacterium longum (B.L) caused by I/R surgery, and colonization by B.L could also exert neuroprotective effects. More importantly, both PNE and B.L could upregulate the expression of GABA receptors in the hippocampus of I/R rats, and coadministration of a GABA-B receptor antagonist could significantly attenuate the neuroprotective effects of PNE and B.L. The study above suggests that the neuroprotective effects of PNE may be largely attributable to its regulation of intestinal flora, and oral treatment with B.L was also useful in therapy of ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/R) by upregulating GABA-B receptors.
