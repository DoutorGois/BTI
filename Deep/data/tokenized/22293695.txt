We previously reported that adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-treated rats serve as a valuable animal model for tricyclic antidepressant-resistant depressive conditions. The present study was undertaken to investigate the changes in neurogenesis in the hippocampus of ACTH-treated rats. Chronic treatment of ACTH decreased the number of bromodeoxyuridine-labeled cells in the dentate gyrus, and the coadministration of imipramine and lithium, and electroconvulsive stimuli recovered these reductions. Furthermore, chronic ACTH treatment also decreased the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and the coadministration of imipramine and lithium, and electroconvulsive stimuli recovered these reductions. These results suggest that antidepressant-resistant depression is caused by the suppression of neurogenesis, and the coadministration of imipramine and lithium, and electroconvulsive stimuli exert an antidepressant-like effect by recovering proliferative signals and neurogenesis.
