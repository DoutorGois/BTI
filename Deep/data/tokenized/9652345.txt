L-762,459 ((+/-)1-(3- inverted question mark[5-carbamoyl-2-2-[(4-hydroxy-3-iodobenzimidoyl)-amino] -ethoxy-methy inverted question mark-6-methyl-4-(4-nitropheny)-1,4-dihydropyridine -3-carbonyl]-amino inverted question mark-propyl)-4-phenyl-1-piperidine-4-carboxylic acid methyl ester), an analog of a series of dihydropyridines previously reported to be selective alpha1A-adrenoceptor subtype antagonists was found to have alpha1A-adrenoceptor subtype selectivity (Ki (nM), la = 1.3, lb = 240, Id = 280). Specific [125I]L-762,459 binding was detected in rat cerebral cortex, hippocampus, vas deferens, kidney, heart and prostate tissues known to contain the alpha1A-adrenoceptor subtype, but not in tissues known to contain alpha1B-adrenoceptor (spleen, liver) and alpha1D-adrenoceptor (aorta). Scatchard analysis of [125I]L-762,459 binding in rat cerebral cortex and prostate indicated a single binding site with a Kd of 0.7 nM and Bmax of 11 (cerebral cortex) and 1 (prostate) pmole/g tissue. Specific and saturable [125I]L-762,459 binding was also found in human cerebral cortex, liver, prostate and vas deferens (Kd = 0.2-0.4 nM, Bmax = 0.4-4 pmole/g tissue). The specific binding in rat and human tissues was competed by non-selective alpha1-adrenoceptor compounds (Ki values in nM: prazosin (0.14-1.2), terazosin (1.8-5.9) and phentolamine (2.4-11)) and selective alpha1A-adrenoceptor compounds [Ki values in nM: (+) niguldipine (0.04-1.2) and SNAP 5399 ((+/-)-2-((2-aminoethyl)oxy)methyl-5-carboxamido-6-ethyl-4-(4-nitropheny l)-3-N-(3-(4,4-diphenylpiperidin-1-yl)propyl)carboxamido-1,4-dihyd ropyridine hydrate (0.5-4.8)]. The results were consistent with the selective binding of [125I]L-762,459 to the alpha1A-adrenoceptor. The specific labeling of the alpha1A-adrenoceptor subtype by [125I]L-762,459 may make it a useful tool to localize the distribution of the alpha1A-adrenoceptor.
