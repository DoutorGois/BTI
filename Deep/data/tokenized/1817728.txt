Early induction of the mRNAs encoding the c-Fos and c-Jun nuclear proteins was examined in rat brain by in situ hybridization at various timepoints following global forebrain ischemia by the method of four-vessel occlusion. All animals were subjected to 20 min of transient ischemia. This produced a pattern of proto-oncogene activation that was most intense in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus 30 min after ischemia, while the hilar cells in the dentate and the pyramidal cells of the CA3 region in the hippocampus showed a more delayed but robust expression of these immediate early genes at 1 h. The neurons of the CA1 region exhibited a more moderate hybridization signal at 1-2 h postischemia. Very little hybridization signal for either immediate early gene could be detected in animals perfused with fixative immediately following ischemia, suggesting that cellular energy levels may have to be restored to a certain level before efficient de novo mRNA synthesis can occur. In the cerebellum, a similar temporal pattern was observed: the granule cells exhibited a prompt but patchy expression of c-fos and c-jun that was followed by a delayed signal in the Purkinje cells. Without exception c-fos and c-jun appeared to be expressed in unison, although the time course of c-fos and c-jun mRNA accumulation and decay was different in various brain regions: invariably the cerebellum returned rapidly to its baseline with virtually no remaining signal at 3 h postischemia, while c-fos and c-jun activation in the hippocampus remained high at 3 h and returned to baseline by 6 h. Several other brain regions showed early production of c-fos and c-jun mRNAs, such as the medial habenula, piriform cortex, the amygdala, the centromedian, lateral posterior, paracentral, intermediodorsal and reuniens nuclei of the thalamus and the ventromedial and dorsal nuclei of the hypothalamus; in the brainstem, the trapezoid body and the noradrenergic neurons of the locus ceruleus as well as the adrenergic neurons in the ventrolateral medulla (C1 group) and nucleus tractus solitarius (C2 group) regions displayed slightly less intense hybridization signals. In addition, the ependyma of the lateral ventricles and the third ventricle showed a prompt albeit short-lived production of c-fos and c-jun mRNAs. Sham-operated animals as well as animals that had survived to one week postischemia showed either no or only trace levels of hybridization signal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
