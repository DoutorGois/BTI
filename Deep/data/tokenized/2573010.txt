In homogenates of rat hippocampus and striatum, but not substantia nigra, somatostatin (SRIF) inhibits forskolin-activated adenylate cyclase in nanomolar concentrations. However, SRIF can also stimulate adenylate cyclase in micromolar concentrations in homogenates of rat hippocampus and substantia nigra. The SRIF octapeptide SMS 201-995 solely inhibits the forskolin-activated adenylate cyclase in the 3 preparations. These results suggest that the SRIF-specific stimulation of adenylate cyclase may be a functional correlate for the brain-specific SRIF receptor subpopulation, whereas the SRIF and SMS 201-995 inhibition of stimulated adenylate cyclase correlate with the SRIF receptor subpopulation present in brain and non-neuronal tissues.
