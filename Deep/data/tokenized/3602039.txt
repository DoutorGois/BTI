The investigation of stress-induced changes in neuronal functioning is important to our understanding of mental disorders, stress-induced psychological impairment, and the emotional reactions of fear and anxiety. Data from previous animal studies have demonstrated various pituitary-adrenal responses to stress and also changes in brain neurotransmitters. We are investigating whether stress-induced neuroendocrine and brain monoamine changes are accompanied by concomitant changes in brain neurotransmitter and/or neuromodulator receptors. We have developed a behavioral paradigm of chronic stress which incorporates sustained stress, continuous performance, and disruption of sleep. Animals which are habituated to press a lever to receive food are trained in an active shock escape task. A matched set of animals housed in identical operant chambers but not exposed to footshock are used as comparative controls. [3H]Cyclohexyladenosine ([3H]CHA) (5-7 nM) binding to A1 adenosine receptors in hypothalamic membrane preparations from rats stressed for three days was fifteen percent higher than in matched controls. However, no differences in [3H]CHA binding were found in tissue preparations from frontal cortex, hippocampus, or striatum, when comparing stressed and matched control rats. Plasma corticosterone levels were higher in stressed rats than in matched controls.
