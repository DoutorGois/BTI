Congenital hypothyroidism is a pediatric endocrine disorder caused by insufficient endogenous thyroid hormone production. Children with congenital hypothyroidism have difficulties with episodic memory and abnormalities in hippocampal structure, suggesting deficient hippocampal functioning. To assess hippocampal activation in adolescents with congenital hypothyroidism (N = 14; age range, 11.5-14.7 years) compared with controls (N = 15; age range, 11.2-15.5 years), a functional magnetic resonance imaging visuospatial memory task was used. In this task, participants had to decide if object pairings were novel or were previously studied or if object pairs were in the same location as they were at study or had switched locations. Despite no group differences in task performance, adolescents with congenital hypothyroidism showed both increased magnitude of hippocampal activation relative to controls and bilateral hippocampal activation when only the left was observed in controls. Furthermore, the increased activation in the congenital hypothyroidism group was correlated with the severity of the hypothyroidism experienced early in life. These results suggest that perinatal deprivation of thyroid hormone has longstanding effects on hippocampal function and may account for memory problems experienced by adolescents with congenital hypothyroidism.
