INTRODUCTION: We evaluated the effect of cerebral amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition in cognitively normal (CN) seniors on regional metabolism of specific brain regions known to be affected by p-tau deposition. METHODS: Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), volumetric magnetic resonance imaging scans, and global amyloid standardized uptake value ratios (SUVr) were obtained for 210 CNs from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-2 (ADNI2). Region of interest (ROI) extraction was used to obtain functional SUVr from six bilateral ROIs: amygdala (AM), entorhinal cortex (EC), hippocampus, lateral orbitofrontal, posterior cingulate (PC), and middle temporal gyrus. Every metabolic SUVr set was averaged and analyzed against the corresponding subject's amyloid SUVr. Correlation analyses were conducted on the full group and between APOE epsilon4-positive and APOE epsilon4-negative subgroups. RESULTS: The APOE epsilon4+ group exhibited significantly higher metabolism in the EC (r = 0.270, P = .038) and AM (r = 0.267, P = .041). When a significance of the difference test was conducted between the APOE epsilon4+ and APOE epsilon4-groups, these same regions remained significant: P = .012 and P = .016, respectively. By contrast, the APOE epsilon4 group displayed only the conventionally expected result of reduced regional metabolism in the PC (r = -0.161, P = .048), with higher Abeta load. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of amyloid positivity on brain metabolism is regionally specific, and APOE epsilon4 status substantially modulates regional glucose uptake in these regions. The APOE epsilon4 allele may cause earlier emergence of clinical symptoms in AD via a mechanism that influences regional metabolic demand in specifically those regions where p-tau deposition is known to occur earliest.
