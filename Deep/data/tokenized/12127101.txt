Neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1) is a member of the EF-hand calcium-binding protein superfamily, which is considered to modulate synaptic transmission and plasticity. In this work, we first examined the distribution patterns of NCS-1 in the hippocampus and cerebellum. The intense NCS-1-immunoreactive (IR) elements in the hippocampus were restricted to dendritic layers, while those in the cerebellum occurred in both dendritic and cellular layers. Then, we examined the exact localization of NCS-1 using immunofluorescent double labeling for NCS-1 and synaptophysin, a marker of presynaptic terminals. In the hippocampus, the mossy fiber systems (terminals and bundles) exhibited intense NCS-1 immunoreactivity. On the other hand, the presumed principal cell dendrites were also NCS-1-IR in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare of Ammon's horn and molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, where NCS-1-IR elements and synaptophysin-IR presynaptic terminals showed characteristic complementary distribution patterns. In the cerebellum, some of the basket cell axon terminals surrounding the somata of Purkinje cells exhibited NCS-1 immunoreactivity, while the pinceau showed consistent labeling for NCS-1. Higher magnification observations revealed that the NCS-1-IR presumed granule cell dendrites and synaptophysin-IR mossy fiber terminals in the glomeruli of the cerebellum showed characteristic complementary distribution patterns. Furthermore, we estimated quantitatively the relative amount of NCS-1 in the presynaptic terminals in individual layers, and confirmed that the mossy fiber terminals in the hippocampus contained comparatively high amounts of NCS-1. These results showed the diverse localization of NCS-1 in pre- and/or postsynaptic elements of the hippocampus and cerebellum, and suggest potential roles in specific synaptic transmission.
