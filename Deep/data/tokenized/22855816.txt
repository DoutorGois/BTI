The accumulation of the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is thought to play a causative role in triggering synaptic dysfunction in neurons, leading to their eventual demise through apoptosis. Abeta is produced and secreted upon sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-secretases and gamma-secretases. However, while Abeta levels have been shown to be increased in the brains of AD patients, little is known about how the cleavage of APP and the subsequent generation of Abeta is influenced, or whether the cleavage process changes over time. It has been proposed that Abeta can bind APP and promote amyloidogenic processing of APP, further enhancing Abeta production. Proof of this idea has remained elusive because a clear mechanism has not been identified, and the promiscuous nature of Abeta binding complicates the task of demonstrating the idea. To work around these problems, we used an antibody-mediated approach to bind and cross-link cell-surface APP in cultured rat primary hippocampal neurons. Here we show that cross-linking of APP is sufficient to raise the levels of Abeta in viable neurons with a concomitant increase in the levels of the beta-secretase BACE1. This appears to occur as a result of a sorting defect that stems from the caspase-3-mediated inactivation of a key sorting adaptor protein, namely GGA3, which prevents the lysosomal degradation of BACE1. Together, our data suggest the occurrence of a positive pathogenic feedback loop involving Abeta and APP in affected neurons possibly allowing Abeta to spread to nearby healthy neurons.
