The putative antidepressive mechanisms of a series of electroconvulsive seizures (ECS) are the following: 1) downregulation of monoaminergic receptor expression in several brain regions, 2) upregulation of the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and 3) increased neurogenesis in the hippocampus. In this study, we used Western blot techniques to present another mechanism in which ECS enhances the autophagy signaling that is involved in the machinery related to synaptic and neural plasticity. Antibodies for conjugated Atg5-Atg12 (58kD) and cleaved light chain protein 3-II (LC3-II; 14 kD) were used to detect autophagy signals. An antibody for cleaved caspase-3 (17 kD) was used to detect alterations in apoptotic signals. Mature BDNF (14kD) expression in the hippocampus was evaluated in order to qualify the effectiveness of the ECS or stress-loading treatment. While significantly increased autophagy signals and no increases in apoptotic signals were detected in the ECS-treated rat hippocampus, the reverse (increased apoptotic signals and no altered autophagy signals) was observed in stressed rat hippocampus. No neuronal cell loss but new mossy fiber sprouting has been reported to accompany multiple ECS treatments, and recent studies have revealed that autophagy processes regulate the number of specific neurotransmitter receptors and the plasticity of synaptic components. The present study illustrated the neuroplastic and neurotrophic profiles of ECS and the neurotoxic impact of severe stress loading on hippocampal regions. This is the first report to demonstrate increased autophagy signals in ECS-treated rat hippocampus and no alterations in autophagy signals in stress-loaded rat hippocampus.
