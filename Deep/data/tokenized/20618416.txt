Exposure to the group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist dihydroxy phenylglycine (DHPG) induces epileptiform activity in the CA3 region of the hippocampus that persists following washout of DHPG. DHPG also can cause long-term depression of synaptic transmission, and at some synapses this may be mediated by endocannabinoids. We evaluated whether the selective cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor antagonists SR 141716 or AM 251 could modify induction of epileptiform activity produced by DHPG exposure. The induction of epileptiform activity by DHPG exposure was significantly reduced by CB1 receptor antagonists, SR 141716 or AM 251. Minimal effects on epileptiform activity were noted once the activity had been induced. In control slices, exposure to DHPG for 30 min produced long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission, on average about a 70% reduction in slope of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). When slices were exposed to both DHPG and SR 141716 (3 microm), LTD did not occur and the population EPSP remained at control values or greater. These results suggest that CB1 receptors mediate some of DHPG effects that result in persistent epileptiform activity, and antagonism of CB1 receptors has antiepileptogenic properties. Paradoxically DHPG also caused LTD of excitatory synaptic transmission in the CA3 region and CB1 receptor antagonism prevents the depression. We hypothesize that the ictal activity induced by DHPG requires depression of synaptic strength and CB1 receptor antagonism prevents this depression and the induction of ictal activity.
