Our previous studies and the others have strongly suggested that JNK signaling pathway plays a critical role in ischemic brain injury. Here, we reported that SP600125, a potent, cell-permeable, selective, and reversible inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), potently decrease neuronal apoptosis induced by global ischemia/reperfusion in the vulnerable hippocampal CA1 subregion. As a result, SP600125 diminished the increased phosphorylation of c-Jun and the increased expression of FasL induced by ischemia/reperfusion in the vulnerable hippocampal CA1 subregion. At the same time, through inhibiting phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and the release of Bax from Bcl-2/Bax dimers, SP600125 attenuated Bax translocation to mitochondria and the release of cytochrome c induced by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Furthermore, the activation of caspase-3 induced by ischemia/reperfusion was also significantly suppressed by preinfusion of SP600125. Importantly, the same neuropotective effect was showed by administration of SP600125 both before and after ischemia. Thus, our findings imply that SP600125 can inhibit the activation of JNK signaling pathway and induce neuroprotection against ischemia/reperfusion in rat hippocampal CA1 region via suppressing the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis. Taken together, these results indicate that targeting the JNK pathway provides a promising therapeutic approach for ischemic brain injury.
