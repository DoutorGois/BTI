Infusion of 120 nmol quinolinic acid into several regions of the rat's brain revealed differences in vulnerability to its neurotoxic effects, as judged by light microscopical analysis. The striatum, the pallidal formation and the hippocampus were the most susceptive brain areas whereas the cerebellum, substantia nigra, amygdala, medial septum and hypothalamus proved more resistant.
