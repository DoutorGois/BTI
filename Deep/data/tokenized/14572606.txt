The induction of oxidative stress by TCDD in various brain regions of rats has been investigated after subchronic exposure. TCDD was administered by gavage to female Sprague-Dawley rats at daily doses of 0, 10, 22, and 46 ng/kg for 13 weeks. The brains were dissected to cerebral cortex (Cc), hippocampus (H), cerebellum (C), and brain stem (Bs); the production of superoxide anion (SA) and lipid peroxides and the activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were determined in those regions. TCDD caused dose-dependent increases in the production of SA and lipid peroxidation in Cc and H and those were associated with dose-dependent suppressions of SOD. While a TCDD dose of 10 ng/kg/d resulted in significant increases in catalase and GSH-Px activities in Cc and H, doses of 22 and 46 ng/kg/d resulted in dose-dependent suppressions of these two enzymes in the same regions. In the C and Bs, TCDD treatment did not result in significant production of SA and lipid peroxidation but it resulted in dose-dependent increases in the activities of various antioxidant enzymes. These results suggest that Cc and H are vulnerable to TCDD-induced oxidative stress after subchronic exposure, and that C and Bs are protected against that effect.
