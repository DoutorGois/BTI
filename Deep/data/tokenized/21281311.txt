Understanding how neural activity is functionally linked to the stem cell niche, is assuming ever increasing importance as hippocampal neurogenesis is shown to be important for modulating the behavioural responses to stress and for certain forms of learning and memory. Neuropeptides such as neuropeptide Y and vasoactive intestinal peptide have emerged as important mediators for signalling local interneuron activity to subgranular zone precursors, however, little is known regarding the effects of neuropeptides that are extrinsic modulators of hippocampal information processing. Here, we show that the galanin GalR2/3 agonist Gal2-11 is both trophic and proliferative for postnatal subgranular precursors and proliferating neuroblasts at 10 nM and is purely trophic at doses as low as 100 pM. We found no effect mediated via GalR1. As galanin is co-released from noradrenergic and serotonergic projection neurons to the dentate gyrus, these findings support a direct effect of galanin on hippocampal neurogenesis, which may partly mediate its antidepressant effect via GalR2/3 receptors.
