Chlorogenic acid (CGA), a major polyphenolic component of many plants, displays antioxidant and neuroprotective properties in neurodegenerative diseases. To investigate whether CGA may influence aluminium (Al) induced cytotoxicity, aluminium chloride (50 muM Al) was administered in primary hippocampal neuronal cells presupplemented with CGA (10, 50 and 100 muM). Our study shows that the exposure to Al caused cell death, Al(3+) accumulation, reactive oxygen species generation and mitochondrial damage in cells. The administration of CGA (50 muM) increased cell viability by 37.5%, decreased the levels of Al(3+) by 26.0%, together with significantly weakening the oxidative damage compared with Al treatment alone. CGA protected neurons against Al-induced oxidative stress by increasing the expression of nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 and its target phase 2 enzymes. The administration of CGA remarkably promoted the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase, creatine kinase and acetylcholinesterase and attenuated the rate of ATP hydrolysis. Our finding shows that CGA has neuroprotective effects against Al-induced cytotoxicity by chelation and antioxidant activation.
