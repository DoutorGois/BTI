alpha 2 adrenergic agonists are used clinically for their anesthetic, analgesic, and sympatholytic actions in surgical patients. All alpha 2 adrenergic receptors, when activated by alpha 2-adrenergic agonists, are able to inhibit adenylate cyclase. We have examined the alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated anesthetic actions of dexmedetomidine, a highly selective alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, after pretreatment of the animals with rolipram, a cyclic AMP (cAMP)-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor, cAMP accumulation and monoamine turnover were measured in the locus coeruleus (LC) and hippocampus (HC) following administration of rolipram [275 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (IP)] and dexmedetomidine (100-500 mg/kg, IP). The hypnotic response to dexmedetomidine was also measured in these animals. In other experiments, rats were stereotactically cannulated in the LC with an indwelling catheter, and after the second day, the tail-flick analgesic response to dexmedetomidine (3.5 mg/0.2 ml LC), following rolipram (275 mg/kg, IP) pretreatment, was assessed. In the presence of elevated cAMP levels, the hypnotic, analgesic, and sympatholytic effects of dexmedetomidine persisted. These data suggest that adenylate cyclase activity does not mediate the cellular responses to alpha 2-adrenergic agonists but instead may act in concert with other alpha 2-adrenoceptor-coupled effector mechanisms to transduce the anesthetic actions of these agents.
