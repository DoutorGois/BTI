Calcium is involved in the physiopathology of cerebral ischemia. Calcium antagonists might prevent the calcium overload and death of cells from ischemically compromised tissue. We compare the neuroprotective effect of various doses (0.2, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg) of two dihydropyridines, nimodipine and the novel 1,4-dihydropyridine derivative PCA50938, and flunarizine in the gerbil model of global ischemia. Improvements in morbidity were observed 2 h after the end of carotid occlusion (McGraw's scale) with 0.5 mg/kg of flunarizine, all doses of PCA50938 and 0.2 mg/kg nimodipine. Neuronal loss in the CA1 sector of the hippocampus was examined. The animals treated with 0.5 mg/kg flunarizine and those treated with 1 mg/kg PCA50938 showed a significant reduction in the percentage of damaged neurons in the hippocampal CA1 area, 72 h after transient ischemia. None of the animals treated with 0.5 mg/kg flunarizine had more than 80% of the evaluated neurons altered. We conclude that PCA50938 and flunarizine may act as neuroprotective drugs with different patterns of dose-response and neuroprotective-morbidity-mortality relationships, in the model of global cerebral ischemia in the gerbil. Flunarizine has a narrow therapeutic range.
