Our previous study has reported that maternal separation (MS) results in abnormal behaviors such as depressive-like and anxious-like behaviors in adult rats. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we focused on the relationship between MS and autophagy in an effort to explain potential mechanisms. Pups experienced MS from postnatal days 7 to 21 and were randomly divided into the control (CON) group and MS group. Data showed that MS induced depressive-like and anxious-like behaviors in adult rats. Compared with the CON group, the glutamate level was obviously increased in the hippocampus (HP) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) of rats in the MS group. Interestingly, both beclin-1 expression and ratio of LC3II/LC3I were decreased in the HP, but they were increased in the PFC. Furthermore, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit 2B (NR2B) expression was significantly increased in the HP and PFC. Additionally, postsynaptic density-95 was increased in the HP; however, it was unchanged in the PFC. Moreover, the expression of synaptophysin was obviously decreased in both the HP and PFC. In conclusion, these findings suggest that MS induces different autophagic responses in the HP and PFC (i.e., the inhibition of autophagy in the HP and the activation of autophagy in the PFC), which can be related to the NR2B signaling pathway.
