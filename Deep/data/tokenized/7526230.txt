A huge uncal branch of the anterior choroidal artery was found in one of 22 cerebral hemispheres. The uncal artery measured 0.7 mm in diameter. It gave off small branches to the uncus, as well as a large parahippocampal artery, the accessory anterior temporal artery, and the anterior hippocampal artery. This uncal artery supplied, in addition to the uncus, most of the ventromedial surface of the parahippocampal gyrus, part of its dorsal surface, the rostromedial portion of the lateral occipitotemporal gyrus, and the rostral part of the hippocampal formation. Such a huge uncal artery has implications for surgery in the uncohippocampal region.
