The novel neurotransmitter/neuromodulator nitric oxide (NO), which is linked to the activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate class of glutamate receptors, has been shown to modify transmitter release in brain tissue. Release of the inhibitory amino acid taurine is also markedly enhanced by N-methyl-D-aspartate and NO-producing agents under normal conditions in the mouse hippocampus. The release of preloaded [3H]taurine from hippocampal slices from adult (3-month-old) and developing (7-day-old) mice was characterized under ischemic conditions in the presence of different NO-generating compounds, hydroxylamine, sodium nitroprusside, and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), using a superfusion system. The ischemia-induced taurine release at both ages was markedly enhanced by 1.0 mM nitroprusside and 1.0 mM SNAP, whereas 5.0 mM hydroxylamine was effective only in adults. The nitroprusside- and SNAP-induced releases were reduced by the inhibitors of NO synthase (nitroarginine and 7-nitroindazole) and NO-sensitive soluble guanylyl cyclase [1H-(1,2,4)oxadiazolo(4,3-a)quinoxalin-1-one], suggesting involvement of the NO/cGMP pathway. The release in ischemia in the absence of Na+ was modified by NO compounds only in adults; the 0.1 mM N-methyl-D-aspartate stimulated taurine release at both ages. The enhanced release of taurine associated with NO production could be beneficial to brain tissue under cell-damaging conditions and corroborates the neuroprotective role of this amino acid, particularly in the immature brain.
