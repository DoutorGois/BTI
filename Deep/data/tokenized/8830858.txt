Previous studies have demonstrated that numerous septohippocampal neurons survive axotomy disconnecting them from target-derived neurotrophins. One reason for survival could be that these neurons have additional projections to other targets supplying them with neurotrophic factor(s). We show that anterograde tracing indeed labeled additional targets of the medial septum (MS) in controls as well as in experimental animals. However, only very few MS neurons could be double-labeled by retrograde tracer injections into the hippocampus and these targets. Thus, for the majority of septohippocampal neurons multiple projections cannot account for their survival following axotomy.
