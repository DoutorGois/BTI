The effects of acupuncture on the expressions of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and c-Fos in the hippocampus of gerbils after transient ischemia were investigated via nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d) histochemistry and Fos immunohistochemistry. In animals of the ischemia-induction groups, both common carotid arteries were occluded for 5 minutes. Animals of the acupunctued groups were given acupunctural treatment at Zusanli twice daily for 9 consecutive days. Acupuncture was shown to decrease NADPH-d and c-Fos levels in both the sham-operation group and the ischemia-induction group. These results suggest that acupuncture modulates the expressions of NOS and c-Fos in the hippocampus.
