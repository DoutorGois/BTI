In our experiment we investigated the effect of subcutaneous administration of paracetamol on the levels of amino acids in the brain structures. Male Wistar rats received for eight weeks paracetamol at two doses: 10 mg/kg b.w. (group P10, n=9) and 50 mg/kg b.w. per day s.c. (group P50, n=9). The regional brain concentrations of amino acids were determined in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus and striatum of control (Con, n=9) and paracetamol-treated groups using HPLC. Evaluation of the biochemical results indicated considerable decrease of the content of amino acids in the striatum (glutamine, glutamic acid, taurine, alanine, aspartic acid) and hypothalamus (glycine) between groups treated with paracetamol compared to the control. In the prefrontal cortex paracetamol increased the level of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The present study demonstrated significant effect of the long term paracetamol treatment on the level of amino acids in the striatum, prefrontal cortex and hypothalamus of rats.
