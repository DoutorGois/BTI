Specific microRNAs (miRNAs), including miR-134, localize to neuronal dendrites, where they control synaptic protein synthesis and plasticity. However, the mechanism of miRNA transport is unknown. We found that the neuronal precursor-miRNA-134 (pre-miR-134) accumulates in dendrites of hippocampal neurons and at synapses in vivo. Dendritic localization of pre-miR-134 is mediated by the DEAH-box helicase DHX36, which directly associates with the pre-miR-134 terminal loop. DHX36 function is required for miR-134-dependent inhibition of target gene expression and the control of dendritic spine size. Dendritically localized pre-miR-134 could provide a local source of miR-134 that can be mobilized in an activity-dependent manner during plasticity.
