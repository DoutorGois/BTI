Methods are described for determining the expression of specific mRNAs and proteins in brain slices, in order to elucidate changes in gene expression during preparation of vibratome slices from hippocampus of adult rats. In situ hybridization with 35S-labeled oligonucleotides was used to evaluate the level and distribution of c-fos and hsp72 mRNAs in 15-microns frozen sections prepared from these slices. Commercially available antibodies were used to examine the distribution of induced Fos and Jun proto-oncogenes as well as expression of the neuronal cytoskeletal protein, microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), in 50-microns vibratome sections from immersion-fixed slices. These studies confirm the induction of c-fos and hsp72 mRNAs during routine incubation, as previously observed in hippocampal slices obtained with a tissue chopper and incubated under somewhat different conditions, indicating that such responses are likely to be common features of many slice preparations. Accumulation of Fos and Jun immunoreactivities in neurons and glia was generally consistent with the distribution of c-fos mRNA induction observed in slices, and the neuronal component of this response was comparable to the expression of these proteins observed after transient ischemia in vivo. MAP2 immunoreactivity detected in the dendritic processes of neurons tended to show an increase in staining intensity during slice incubation, although loss of dendritic staining in specific regions was occasionally observed in association with the absence of Fos and Jun expression and histological evidence of neuron damage. These results support the use of MAP2 immunoreactivity as a sensitive indicator of neuronal integrity in slices.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
