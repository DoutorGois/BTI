BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Sophoridine is a new anticancer drug with noticeable antitumor action and lower toxicity. No marked influence on bone marrow was found till now. The main toxicity is presented in nervous system. This study was to observe the morphological changes of the nervous system of the rats, which were treated with maximum dose of sorphoridine for a long time. METHODS: 30 rats,half of male when and half of female, were randomly divided into experimental group and control group. In the experimental group,rats were treated with maximum dose of sorphoridine [32 mg x(kg x d)(-1) ip, qd] for 60 days. In control group, rats were treated with the same volume of saline everyday for 60 days. The rats in both groups were killed at 20 d, 40 d, 60 d, and 75 d, respectively. The brain and spinal cord were taken out and made into pathological slices, which were stained by HE stain and special stain, sach as Nissel's body stain, glial fibrillary stain and myelin sheath stain. The differences in morphology between the two groups was observed. RESULTS: No pathological change was found in rats' cerebral cortex,internal capsul, striated body, hippocampus, substantia nigra,and spinal cord when the rats' were treated with sophoridine 32 mg x(kg x d)(-1) ip for 20 d, 40 d, 60 d. In the rats who had presented nervous system syndrome repeatedly or died for convulsion, or the rats who were killed in convalescence period (15 d after final administration), there was no pathological change either. CONCLUSION: No pathological changes and delayed changes in the nervous tissues were found when the rats were given maximum dose of Sophoridine continuously for 60 d. Our study showed that the syndrome of nervous system caused by Sophoridine is functional and stimulational, and can be recovered,and there is no any delayed change and sequela.
