Disturbances in neuronal communication induced by rapid temperature changes are a risk in the context of accidental hypothermia and would be fatal for hibernators during arousal from hibernation. Therefore, we investigated the effects of rapid temperature changes on synaptically induced CA1 population spikes in hippocampal slices from golden hamsters (hibernators) and rats (non-hibernators). Temperature was changed ramp-like by 0.3 degrees C/min, which corresponds to the rise of body temperature in golden hamsters during arousal from hibernation. During cooling from 35 to 10-15 degrees C, the population spike amplitude increased, reached maximal values at 25-30 degrees C and 20-25 degrees C in hamster and rat slices, respectively, and then decreased with further cooling. During rewarming, hamster slices displayed the same temperature dependence as during cooling. In contrast, in rat slices dynamic effects of the temperature change occurred. These were most obvious in a strong depression of the spike amplitude during rewarming as compared to cooling. Above 26-29 degrees C, the depression was superimposed by an excitatory effect. The depression was largely attenuated by theophylline (100-200 microM) and thus seems to be based on an increase of the concentration of endogenous adenosine, which in turn may result from an imbalance in energy metabolism during warming. The lack of warming-related depression in hamster slices can be explained by a lower sensitivity for adenosine as compared to rat slices. In addition, a better resistance of metabolic balance against rapid temperature changes may prevent large elevations of endogenous adenosine in the hamster hippocampus. For hibernators, the avoidance of temperature change-induced disturbances of neuronal communication may be a prerequisite for safe arousal from hibernation.
