BACKGROUND: A child whose left temporal lobe contained mesial, anterior and basal structures but lacked superio-lateral cortex had intractable epilepsy secondary to a porencephalic cyst. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) shows equivalent current dipoles (ECDs) as dipole modeling for temporal lobe epilepsy rather than in an exact location. AIM: We hypothesized that the magnetic fields generated by the epileptic discharges in mesio-basal temporal areas could be detected by MEG without interference from the superio-lateral temporal cortices. METHODS: We analyzed MEG spikes using single dipole analysis and synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM), and compared with EEG spike topography. RESULTS: Two MEG ECDs corresponding to T3 spikes localized to the anterior mesio-basal temporal region with vertical orientation. Sixteen MEG ECDs corresponding to T5 spikes localized to the middle to posterior mesio-basal temporal region with vertical orientation. SAM revealed maximum current density at hippocampus and anterior fusiform gyrus for T3 spikes, and at posterior hippocampus and fusiform gyrus for T5 spikes. CONCLUSION: Vertically oriented ECDs were obtained without superio-lateral temporal cortices because of temporo-parieto-occipital porencephalic cyst. The absence of superio-lateral temporal cortices, prominent temporal EEG spikes, less prominent MEG spikes, and mesio-basal SAM spikes indicated that the vertically oriented ECDs were projected directly from the mesio-basal temporal region.
