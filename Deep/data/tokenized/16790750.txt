Neuronal dysfunction can occur in the course of sepsis without meningitis. Sepsis-associated neuronal damage (SAND) was observed in the hippocampus within hours in experimental pneumococcal bacteremia. Intravascular challenge with purified bacterial cell wall recapitulated SAND. SAND persisted in PAFr(-/-) mice but was partially mitigated in mice lacking cell wall recognition proteins TLR2 and Nod2 and in mice overexpressing interleukin-10 (IL-10) in macrophages. Thus, cell wall drives SAND through IL-10-repressible inflammatory events. Treatment with CDP-choline ameliorated SAND, suggesting that it may be an effective adjunctive therapy to increase survival and reduce organ damage in sepsis.
