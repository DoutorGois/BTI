Glucocorticoids induced psychiatric disorders mostly emerge within the first weeks of corticotherapy. They occur in a variety of qualitatively distinct forms. Manic symptoms are among the most important manifestations of corticosteroids-induced psychiatric toxicity. The incidence of moderate to severe induced reactions is estimated at 5%. Acute cognitive induced disorders are common although moderate. These cognitive alterations specifically affect hippocampal dependant memory process. Chronic cognitive disorders are uncommon, complex, and inconsistent with an isolated alteration of the hippocampal structure. Corticotherapy stop also induced frequent psychiatric withdrawal symptoms, which are mostly depressive symptoms. Occurrence of such symptoms is likely to explain the addictive potentialities of glucocorticoids.
