In this study we tested the hypothesis that dantrolene, an established inhibitor of the skeletal muscle isoform of the ryanodine receptor, may interfere with activity of NMDA receptors in neurons. We assessed the effects of dantrolene on [(3)H]MK-801 and [(3)H]glycine binding to isolated rat cortical membranes. Dantrolene inhibited [(3)H]MK-801 binding in the presence of 100 microM NMDA with an IC(50) of 58.4 microM. The IC(50) value increased to 99.6, 343.0 and 364.6 microM in the presence of 10, 30 and 50 microM glycine, respectively, suggesting that dantrolene competes with glycine for binding site at the NMDA receptor complex. A binding assay using [(3)H]glycine confirmed this supposition: dantrolene inhibited strychnine-insensitive glycine binding in a dose-dependent way. Thus, our results show that dantrolene at concentrations of 50-100 microM and higher blocks the glycine binding site of the NMDA receptor complex and in this way inhibits activation of the NMDA ion channel. These data reveal a new mechanism of dantrolene action in neuronal tissue. Our results also suggest that the neuroprotective effect of dantrolene may be at least partly explained by its activity as a non-competitive antagonist of NMDA receptors.
