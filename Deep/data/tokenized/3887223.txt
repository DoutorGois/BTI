Previous studies have demonstrated a neuronal system containing an immunoreactive ranatensin-like peptide (irRT) in rat brain. The results of the present study describe the ascending projections of a prominent irRT cell group in the pons. A major pontine irRT fiber system was shown to innervate the hippocampus but not the mammillary body.
