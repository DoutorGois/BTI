We investigated phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) at two major sites, Ser1177 and Thr495, which has a critical role to control its activity, in the gerbil hippocampal microvasculature after transient forebrain ischemia. Ser1177 phosphorylation was unchanged by 24 h after reperfusion, despite post-ischemic up-regulation of eNOS protein. However, Thr495 phosphorylation significantly and persistently decreased by 48 h. We here defined the changes in eNOS phosphorylation in vivo following brain ischemia/reperfusion. (ischemia).
