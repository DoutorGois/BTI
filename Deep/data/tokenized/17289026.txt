Status epilepticus (SE) is a life-threatening neurological disorder associated with a significant morbidity and mortality. Benzodiazepines are the initial drugs of choice for the treatment of SE. Despite aggressive treatment, over 40% of SE cases are refractory to the initial treatment with two or more medications. It would be a major advance in the clinical management of SE to identify novel anticonvulsant agents that do not lose their ability to treat SE with increasing seizure duration. Cannabinoids have recently been demonstrated to regulate seizure activity in brain. However, it remains to be seen whether they develop pharmacoresistance upon prolonged SE. In this study, we used low Mg(2+) to induce SE in hippocampal neuronal cultures and in agreement with animal models and human SE confirm the development of resistance to benzodiazepine with increasing durations of SE. Thus, lorazepam (1 microM) was effective in blocking low Mg(2+) induced high-frequency spiking for up to 30 min into SE. However, by 1 h and 2 h of SE onset it was only 10-15% effective in suppressing SE. In contrast, the cannabinoid type-1 (CB1) receptor agonist, WIN 55,212-2 (1 microM) in a CB1 receptor-dependent manner completely abolished SE at all the time points tested even out to 2 h after SE onset, a condition where resistance developed to lorazepam. Thus, the use of cannabinoids in the treatment of SE may offer a unique approach to controlling SE without the development of pharmacoresistance observed with conventional treatments.
