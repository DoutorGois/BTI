Regulation of acetylcholine metabolism varied in brain slices from hippocampus and septum which have different proportions of cholinergic nerve cell bodies and nerve endings. Anoxia (0% oxygen) inhibited acetylcholine synthesis (-77%) and its calcium-dependent release (-87%) from hippocampal slices but had no effect on synthesis or release by septal slices. [1,5-14C]Citrate incorporation into acetylcholine was higher in septum than in hippocampus, which suggested that citrate metabolism differs regionally. (-)Hydroxycitrate, a specific inhibitor of ATP citrate (pro3S)-lyase (EC 4.1.3.8), reduced [U-14C]glucose incorporation into acetylcholine more in septal than in hippocampal slices. 14CO2 production from glucose or citrate was similar in control and experimental conditions in the two regions. These findings indicate that acetylcholine metabolism varies regionally, which may partially explain the selective vulnerability of certain brain areas to anoxia and other metabolic insults.
