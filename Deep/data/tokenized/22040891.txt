Accumulating evidence in humans demonstrates that visuo-spatial deficits are the most consistently reported cognitive abnormalities in Parkinson's disease (PD). Ezrin, radixin, and moesin are collectively known as ERM proteins. Although ERM proteins have important implications in cell-shape determination and relevant signaling pathway, they have not been studied in the hippocampus in association with visuo-spatial memory impairments. The purpose of the present study is to examine whether the expression level of ERM proteins in the hippocampus is changed by an intrastriatal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in mice. The intrastriatal injection of 6-OHDA induced partial dopaminergic deficits and spatial memory impairments. We also found that ezrin was increased in the hippocampus by the microinjection of 6-OHDA. On the other hand, protein levels of radixin and moesin were not influenced by 6-OHDA lesions. These results suggest that excessive ezrin may be related to visuo-spatial memory impairments.
