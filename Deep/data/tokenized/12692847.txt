Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is a fatal hereditary neurovisceral disorder with diagnostically relevant intracellular accumulation of cholesterol in non-brain tissue, for example the spleen and fibroblasts. In the brain, many ballooned neurons are seen. Using filipin microfluorodensitometry, significant accumulations of free cholesterol in specified neurons have been described in NPC patients. The present study demonstrates spatial and temporal accumulation of free cholesterol in the brains of homozygous NPC (-(npc)/-(npc)) mice, a widely acknowledged mouse model, and in primarily cultured neurons therefrom. Intraneuronal storage of free cholesterol was already prominent at a pre-clinical stage in various grey matter areas of the murine cerebral cortex. Hippocampal areas showed differential development of the pathological distribution of free cholesterol. The pyramidal cells in the CA3 sector of Ammon's horn were affected much earlier than in CA1. Some of the deeper cerebral nuclei were affected only slightly, even at the final stage. Neurons (E15-E17) cultured in a cholesterol-free medium also showed massive accumulation of intracellular free cholesterol. In addition, brains from the murine NPC model for Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like changes in the microtubule-associated protein tau were tested using the Gallyas silver technique and AT8-immunolabelling, since both human diseases are accompanied by intraneuronal tangles made up of tau protein aggregations. Although the analysis failed to show classical silver-stainable tangles of the AD type in the NPC mice, tau protein phosphorylated at epitopes considered to represent early stages of AD was found. This further strengthens the concept that an alteration in cholesterol metabolism may play an important role in AD. The NPC mouse model may thus serve as a tool to analyse the role of cholesterol in initial changes of tau that eventually lead to the formation of tangles in both NPC and AD.
