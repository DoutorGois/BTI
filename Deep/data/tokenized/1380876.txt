We examined whether preconditioning with sublethal ischemia protects against neuronal damage following subsequent lethal ischemic insults. Forebrain ischemia for 3 min in Wistar rats increased heat shock protein-70 immunoreactivity in the hippocampal CA1 subfield but produced no neuronal damage. Preconditioning with 3 min of ischemia followed by 3 days of reperfusion protected against hippocampal CA1 neuronal damage following 6 and 8 min of ischemia but not damage after 10 min of ischemia. The result strongly suggests that stress response induced by sublethal ischemia protects against ischemic brain damage.
