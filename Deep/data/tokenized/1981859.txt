Using a somatostatin-gold conjugate as ligand, high-affinity binding sites for this neuropeptide were demonstrated at three levels: (i) cultured astrocytes from rat cortex, (ii) hippocampal slice cultures, and (iii) frozen tissue sections of rat telencephalon. The conjugate proved as active as the native peptide in competing for the binding sites. Light-microscopic visualization of bound ligand was achieved by silver intensification of the colloidal gold. This method is faster and yields superior resolution compared with autoradiography. Cultured astrocytes from cortex and hippocampus could be labeled by the ligand. At the light- and electron-microscopic level, astrocytes could be double-labeled by the somatostatin-gold conjugate and immunostaining for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). In hippocampal slice cultures, the conjugate did not penetrate into the neuropil because of a covering glial layer. However, a portion of this completely GFAP-positive covering glia reacted with the somatostatin ligand. In frozen brain sections, apart from delicate punctate structures, two types of labeled glia cells were seen: single stellate astrocytes and perivascular glia cells.
