OBJECTIVE: To analyze the survival and the changes of proportions of Calbindin, Calretinin and Parvalbumin positive neurons in mouse hippocampal CA area at chronic stage of Pilocarpine-induced epilepsy. METHODS: Calbindin, Calretinin and Parvalbumin immunofluoresence staining were done 2 months after Pilocarpine-induced epilepsy in mice or saline injection. RESULTS: Two months after Pilocarine-induced epilepsy, the number of Calbindin, Calretinin and Parvalbumin positive neurons in the CA area decreased significantly compared with the control (P<0.01), especially the Calbindin positive neurons had a great drop and Pavalbumin positive neurons had a least drop. At the chronic stage of epilepsy, the proportion of Calbindin, Calretinin and Parvalbumin positive neurons in the CA area was changed. The content of Pavalbumin positive neurons increased whereas the content of Calbindin positive neurons decreased significantly compared with the control (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: The changes of proportions of Calbindin, Calretinin and Parvalbumin positive neurons in the CA area of mouse hippocampus may be a factor in the ongoing epileptic activity at chronic stage of Pilocarpine-induced epilepsy.
