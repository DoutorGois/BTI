The hippocampal mossy fiber endings of rats were examined with electron microscopy, following the administration of picrotoxin. In the control group, many small round clear vesicles (40-60 nm in diameter) filled the nerve endings. Further, it was noted that large dense-core vesicles (80-100 nm in diameter) in small numbers were scattered among these small clear vesicles. After administration of picrotoxin, the large dense-core vesicles increased in number and accumulated next to the presynaptic membrane. These vesicles were often fused to the presynaptic membrane, in the form of omega-shaped profiles.
