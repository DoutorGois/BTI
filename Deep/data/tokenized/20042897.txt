In the CA1 region of mouse hippocampal slices, a strong tetanic stimulation triggers a long-lasting long-term potentiation (L-LTP), which requires transcription for the development of its late phase. Nevertheless, we were able to elicit such an L-LTP in CA1 dendrites separated from their somas provided that we restricted our investigations to isolated dendrites where a very robust early LTP was triggered. This particular type of L-LTP, which relied on translation of preexisting messenger RNAs - as it was blocked by anisomycin - could not be captured by another pathway activated only by a weak tetanic stimulation. This suggests that the plasticity-related proteins resulting from translation of messenger RNAs in dendrites cannot pass from the synaptic site where they were synthesized to another one.
