An increase in in vivo (3H) spiperone binding was observed in rat hippocampal formation and striatum after repeated treatment with haloperidol. This suggests that in hippocampus as well as in striatum prolonged blockade of dopaminergic transmission by a neuroleptic agent results in the development of a supersensitivity of the dopamine receptors.
