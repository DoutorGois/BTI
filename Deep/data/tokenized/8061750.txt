With the aim of establishing a quantitative structural basis for comparative and experimental studies, the volumes of the hippocampal subdivisions and the total number of neurons in each subdivision were estimated in domestic pig brains using modern stereological techniques. In addition to a detailed description of the stereological methods used in the analysis, comprehensive descriptions of the architectonic boundaries of the subdivisions are included. The absolute and relative volumes of the subdivisions were compared to those of a number of other species and the relationship between the number of neurons and the volume of the subdivisions was compared to that in homologous subdivisions of laboratory rats and humans. The methodology used to estimate the volumes and the total number of neurons in the individual subdivisions were evaluated with regard to the sensitivity that they can provide in experimental studies.
