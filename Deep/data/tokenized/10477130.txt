Concentrations of immunoreactive galanin were compared in eight gross brain regions of ovariectomized female rats treated with either estradiol, estradiol + progesterone, estradiol + norethisterone, or placebo. Higher concentrations with estradiol treatment compared with placebo were found in the pituitary (357%), frontal cortex (162%), occipital cortex (174%), hippocampus (170%), and median eminence (202%). A more profound difference with addition of progesterone or norethisterone was seen in the pituitary (529% and 467%, respectively). Sex steroids, particularly estradiol, modulate galanin concentrations not only in reproductive, but also in nonreproductive, brain regions.
