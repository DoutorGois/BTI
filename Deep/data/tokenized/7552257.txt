Extracellular recordings were made from the CA1 pyramidal cell layer of hippocampal slices in response to stimulation of Schaffer collateral fibres in stratum radiatum. Alphaxalone and 5 alpha-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one potentiated the inhibitory effect of muscimol on the population spike size at low concentrations (0.5 and 1 microM) that had no significant effect on the spike size by themselves. This profile is in agreement with other reports which have described the effect of these neurosteroids as barbiturate-like. Alphaxalone and 5 alpha-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one also at low concentrations potentiated the inhibitory effect of adenosine alone and in the presence of 1 mM barium which blocked adenosine activated potassium channels. Alphaxalone failed to potentiate the inhibitory effect of adenosine in the presence of 1 microM bicuculline. It is concluded that these neurosteroids enhanced the potentiative interaction between adenosine and muscimol in the presence of barium. The results indicate that adenosine's effects are normally enhanced by virtue of the potentiative interaction occurring with endogenous GABA.
