Limbic seizure status was induced by microinjection of kainic acid into a unilateral amygdala in rats. Two hours after kainic acid injection, distant neuronal cell damage was produced, especially in the hippocampal CA3 on the kainic acid-injected side. In order to elucidate the mechanism of this neuronal cell damage, local cerebral glucose utilization and local cerebral blood flow were studied by means of an autoradiographic method using [14C]2-deoxyglucose and [14C]iodoantipyrine during kainic acid-induced limbic seizure status. These studies were performed 2 h after kainic acid microinjection into a unilateral amygdala. Both local cerebral glucose utilization and local cerebral blood flow were remarkably increased in the limbic system, ventrobasal complex of the thalamus, septal nucleus, nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus, substantia nigra and hypothalamus on the kainic acid-injected side. In the hippocampus, local cerebral glucose utilization increased 2.6 times control in CA1 and 4.1 times in CA3, whereas the rates of increase in local cerebral blood flow were similarly low in CA1 and CA3: 1.2 and 1.4 times control, respectively. The results demonstrated that the degree of uncoupling of local cerebral glucose utilization and local cerebral blood flow were higher in CA3 than in CA1, and also suggested that relative hypoxia occurred in CA3 in this high degree of uncoupling, resulting in pyramidal cell damage in CA3 in kainic acid-induced limbic seizure status.
