Colchicine, a neurotoxin that preferentially destroys dentate gyrus granule cells and mossy fibers, was injected into the hippocampus of adult rats. Three weeks later, the rats were tested for colchicine-induced hypermotility after which they received fetal hippocampal explants. Locomotor activity was retested three weeks later, after which the rats were trained over a period of four weeks on a food-reinforced, spatial, working memory task in an 8-arm radial maze. Fetal hippocampal explants were found to attenuate significantly the colchicine-induced hypermotility and spatial learning deficits. Histological observations showed the presence of surviving hippocampal explants in both the lesioned and the control rat brains, suggesting that the presence of viable implants facilitates the recovery of behavioral function in rats with spatial memory deficits.
