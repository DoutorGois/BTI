Cellular composition of all the layers of anterior, central and posterior regions of rat cerebral piriform cortex was studied 2 weeks and 1 month after specific electrical stimulation (kindling) of ventral hippocampus through electrodes implanted one week earlier. According to the data of stereological analysis, following at both time intervals after kindling, all the layers in all the regions of piriform cortex demonstrated the significant decrease in numbers of interneurons and pyramidal cells. Three weeks after electrode implantation into the ventral hippocampus, the number of both pyramidal cells and interneurons was also found to be reduced in the central region of piriform cortex of rats in which stimulation had not been performed. The participation of piriform cortex in epileptogenesis is suggested on the basis of literature and personal data.
