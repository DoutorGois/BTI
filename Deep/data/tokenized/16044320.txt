The transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily comprises a group of non-selective cation channels that have been implicated in both receptor and store-operated channel functions. The family of the classical TRPs (TRPCs) consists of seven members (TRPC1-7). The presence of TRPC1 and TRPC5 mRNA in the brain has previously been demonstrated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. However, the distribution of these receptors within different brain areas of mice has not been investigated in detail. We have used antibodies directed against TRPC1 and TRPC5 to study the distribution and localization of these channels in murine medial temporal lobe structures. Both TRPC1 and TRPC5 channels are present in the various nuclei of the amygdala, in the hippocampus, and in the subiculum and the entorhinal cortex. We have found that TRPC1 channels are primarily expressed on cell somata and on dendrites, whereas TRPC5 channels are exclusively located on cell bodies. Moreover, TRPC1 channels are selectively expressed by neurons, whereas TRPC5 channels are mainly expressed by neurons, but also by non-neuronal cells. The expression of TRPC1 and TRPC5 channels in mammalian temporal lobe structures suggests their involvement in neuronal plasticity, learning and memory.
