The effects of phencyclidine and the dioxolane enantiomers, dexoxadrol and levoxadrol, on long-term potentiation in the hippocampus were compared. Field potentials were evoked by stimulation of Schaffer collaterals and recorded from the CA1 region. Long-term potentiation was induced by stimulation with a single train of 25 pulses at 50 Hz. The drugs were delivered by pressure, 1 min before tetanization. Phencyclidine and its receptors ligand, dexoxadrol, abolished the induction of long-term potentiation. Levoxadrol which has very low affinity for the phencyclidine receptor was devoid of this action although it reduced the magnitude of long-term potentiation. These results indicate that phencyclidine blocks long-term potentiation by stereospecific activation of phencyclidine receptors.
