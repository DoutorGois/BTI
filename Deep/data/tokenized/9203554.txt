We have previously shown that subordination causes a reduction in the levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine selectively in the frontal cortex [6]. These monoamines are catabolised mainly by the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO) which exists in two isoforms; MAO-A and MAO-B. The present study was carried out to determine whether there is any change in the activity of these two iso-enzymes induced by subordination and if any such alteration is confined to the frontal cortex. The animal model of dominance-subordination used was a worker-parasite paradigm in male Wistar rats. The enzyme activities were measured in five brain regions, the frontal cortex, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus and striatum, using kynuramine as the substrate. Clorgyline and L-deprenyl were used in vitro to block the activities of MAO-A and MAO-B, respectively. There was a significant (P < 0.001) reduction in the activity of MAO-A as well as MAO-B selectively in the frontal cortex of the subordinate animals. This finding may suggest a reduced neurotransmitter turnover in the serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons terminating in the frontal cortex.
