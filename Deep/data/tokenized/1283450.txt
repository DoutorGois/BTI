The existence of neurons expressing preprogalanin mRNA in the monkey hippocampal formation was demonstrated using in situ hybridization of a radio-labelled cRNA probe transcribed from human preprogalanin cDNA. Specific hybridization occurred in neurons of the hilus of the dentate gyrus, fields CA1-3 in Ammon's horn, subiculum, presubiculum, parasubiculum and occasionally in neurons of the entorhinal cortex. These findings suggest that galanin is synthesized by neurons intrinsic to the monkey hippocampal formation.
