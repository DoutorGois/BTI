The effects of cholinomimetics administered into the lateral brain ventricle, hippocampus, anterior thalamus and various areas of hypothalamus, on rat behavior and regional content of biogenic amines in the rat brain are reported. It has been found that stimulation of animals brought about by the stimulation of the central cholinergic the system is the result of excitation of both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. It has also been found that the cholinergic system of anterior part of hypothalamus participates in the regulation of basic forms of rat behavior and the degree of excitation of central muscarinic neurons determines the appearance of various behavioral changes. The presence of functional interaction between cholinergic and dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons in the rat anterior hypothalamus has been shown.
