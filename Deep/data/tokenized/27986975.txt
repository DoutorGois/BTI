Altered brain somatostatin functions recently appeared as key elements for the pathogenesis of stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders. The hippocampus exerts an inhibitory feedback on stress but the mechanisms involved remain unclear. We investigated herein the role of hippocampal somatostatin receptor subtypes in both stress response and behavioral emotionality using C57BL/6, wild type and sst2 or sst4 knockout mice. Inhibitory effects of hippocampal infusions of somatostatin agonists on stress-induced hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) activity were tested by monitoring peripheral blood and local hippocampus corticosterone levels, the latter by using microdialysis. Anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects were determined in the elevated-plus maze, open field, forced swimming, and stress-sensitive beam walking tests. Hippocampal injections of somatostatin analogs and sst2 or sst4, but not sst1 or sst3 receptor agonists produced rapid and sustained inhibition of HPA axis. sst2 agonists selectively produced anxiolytic-like behaviors whereas both sst2 and sst4 agonists had antidepressant-like effects. Consistent with these findings, high corticosterone levels and anxiety were found in sst2KO mice and depressive-like behaviors observed in both sst2KO and sst4KO strains. Both hippocampal sst2 and sst4 receptors selectively inhibit stress-induced HPA axis activation but mediate anxiolytic and antidepressive effects through distinct mechanisms. Such results are to be accounted for in development of pathway-specific somatostatin receptor agents in the treatment of hypercortisolism (Cushing's disease) and stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders.
