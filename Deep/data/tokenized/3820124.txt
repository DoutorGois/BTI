In the present study the author examined the effects of dithizone on hippocampal and cortical EEG by power spectral analysis in the moving mouse. Following results were obtained. Administration of dithizone 100 mg/kg i. p. produced almost loss of electrical activities on EEG which began 409 sec after injection and lasted approximately up to 706 sec. In recovery period waveform showed shift to slower frequencies apparent by 60 min. Heart rate decreases were seen between 5 and 20 min after 100 mg/kg i. p. injection. Dithizone produced dose-dependent changes in hippocampal and heart rate activities. Abolished EEG by dithizone administration were immediately recovered by zinc-acetate application. Injection of vehicle had no significant effect on hippocampal and cortical EEG.
