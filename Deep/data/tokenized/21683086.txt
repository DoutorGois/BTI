AIMS: We analyzed the effects of the short- and long-term administration of estradiol (E2) or progesterone (P4) after ovariectomy on the expression of MAP2, Tau and GFAP in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. MAIN METHODS: Sprague Dawley rats were ovariectomized and immediately treated with E2 or P4 for 2 or 18 weeks. At the end of treatments, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were excised, proteins were extracted and MAP2, Tau and GFAP were analyzed by Western blot. KEY FINDINGS: MAP2 and Tau content was not modified by E2 in the prefrontal cortex. On the contrary, P4 decreased MAP2 content after a short-term treatment, while it increased that of MAP2 and TAU in this brain region after a long-term treatment. E2 increased MAP2 content in hippocampus. In this region, short-term administration of P4 increased that of MAP2. GFAP content was diminished after a long-term administration of P4 in hippocampus. SIGNIFICANCE: Current data emphasize the importance of short- and long-term sex steroid treatment on neuronal and glial cytoskeletal proteins expression.
