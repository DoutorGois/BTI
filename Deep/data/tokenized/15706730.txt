Studies of spontaneous and kindled electrophysiological brain activity following AW emphasize the important contribution of several variables to the severity of AW and to the associated long-lasting changes in brain function. Thus, withdrawal severity depends on the pattern of alcohol intake (e.g., withdrawal history) as well as on the total amount of alcohol exposure. Moreover, different brain regions respond differently to various patterns of alcohol exposure.
