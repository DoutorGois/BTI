The present study was aimed to investigate neuroprotective effects of early and late ischemic preconditioning in the acute phase of ischemic brain damage in rats. It was found that a single five-minute ischemic episode of early ischemic preconditioning did not lead to significant neuroprotective effects in comparison with control group, while three five-minute ischemic episode early ischemic preconditioning accompanied by a significant increase in neurological deficit and growing damage rate in CA1 hippocampus neurons. In contrast, later ischemic preconditioning in form of single five-minute episode 24 hours before ischemia modeling, provided a significant neuroprotective effect, manifesting reduced neurological deficit and maintaining viability of CA1 hippocampus neurons.
