Nerve growth factor (NGF) was injected intraventricularly during 4 weeks into adult rats with unilateral partial lesions of the cholinergic septo-hippocampal pathway. On the lesioned side, NGF treatment elevated choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity up to 60% above the activity measured on the lesioned side of cytochrome c-treated controls. On the unlesioned side, NGF treatment increased ChAT activity only to an insignificant degree. ChAT activity in the septum of NGF-treated animals was increased by 60% as compared to controls. The NGF-induced increases on the lesioned side and in the septum were not accompanied by elevations in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. Furthermore, histochemical analysis revealed no difference in AChE staining pattern or intensity between NGF-treated and control animals. The lack of effect on AChE strongly suggests that the increases in ChAT activity in hippocampus and septum are due to an elevation of ChAT activity within cholinergic neurons surviving the lesion rather than to a promotion of sprouting of cholinergic fibers.
