Ischemia is characterized by oxidative stress and changes in the antioxidant defense system. Our recent in vitro study showed that 2-cyclopropylimino-3-methyl-1,3-thiazoline hydrochloride protects cortical astrocytes against oxidative stress. In the current study, we examined the effects of 2-cyclopropylimino-3-methyl- 1,3-thiazoline hydrochloride on ischemia-induced neuronal damage in a gerbil ischemia/reperfusion models. Extensive neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 area was observed 4 days after ischemia/reperfusion. Intraperitoneal injection of 2-cyclopropylimino- 3-methyl-1,3-thiazoline hydrochloride (0.3 mg/kg body weight) significantly prevented neuronal death in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in response to transient forebrain ischemia. 2-Cyclopropylimino-3-methyl-1,3-thiazoline hydrochloride administration reduced ischemia-induced increases in reactive oxygen species levels and malondialdehyde content. It also attenuated the associated reductions in glutathione level and superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activities. Taken together, our results suggest that 2-cyclopropylimino- 3-methyl-1,3-thiazoline hydrochloride protects against ischemia-induced neuronal damage by reducing oxidative stress through its antioxidant actions.
