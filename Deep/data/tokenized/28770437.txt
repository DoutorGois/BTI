It has been suggested that age-related neurodegeneration might be associated with neuropeptide Y (NPY); sirtuin1 (SIRT1) and forkhead box transcription factors O subfamily (FOXOs) pathways. Melatonin, a hormone mainly secreted by the pineal gland, is another anti-aging agent associated with the SIRT1-FOXOs pathway. This study aimed to compare the effects of melatonin (Mel) and caloric restriction (CR) on the expression of Sirt1, FoxO1, FoxO3a and FOXOs target genes in the aging mouse hippocampus. Neuropeptide Y-knockout (NpyKO) and wild-type (WT) male mice aged 19 months were previously treated either with food ad libitum or CR for 16 months. WT old animals were divided into four groups: control, CR, Mel and CR+Mel treated groups. The Mel and CR+Mel were treated with melatonin 10 mg/kg, daily, subcutaneously for 7 consecutive days. Mel treatment upregulated the mRNA expression of Sirt1, FOXOs (FoxO1 and FoxO3a) target genes that regulated the cell cycle [e.g., cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (p27)], Wingless and INT-1 (Wnt1) and inducible signaling pathway protein 1 (Wisp1) in the aged mouse hippocampus. CR treatment also showed the similar actions. However, the mRNA expression of Sirt1, FoxO1, FoxO3a, p27 or Wisp1 did not alter in the CR+Mel group when compared with CR or Mel group. Melatonin could not produce any additive effect on the CR treatment group, suggesting that both treatments mimicked the effect, possibly via the same pathway. NPY which mediates physiological adaptations to energy deficits is an essential link between CR and longevity in mice. In order to focus on the role of Npy in mediating the effects of melatonin, the gene expression between NpyKO and WT male mice were compared. Our data showed that, in the absence of Npy, melatonin could not mediate effects on those gene expressions, suggesting that Npy was required for melatonin to mediate the effect, possibly, on life extension.
