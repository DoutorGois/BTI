To investigate the role of the LIM-kinase (LIMK) family in the regulation of ADF/cofilin phosphorylation and synaptic function in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), we conducted biochemical and electrophysiological analysis using mice that were genetically altered in the expression of LIMK-1 and LIMK-2. We showed here that while LIMK-2 knockout mice exhibited minimal abnormalities, the LIMK-1/2 double knockout mice were more severely impaired in both ADF/cofilin phosphorylation and excitatory synaptic function in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. These results indicate a critical role for the LIMK family in the regulation of ADF/cofilin and synaptic function in the brain.
