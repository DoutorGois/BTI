Acute isolation of hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells using trypsin produces neurons which respond to kainate and quisqualate but not N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). Incubation of 6- to 12-day-old cultured hippocampal neurons or slices of pyriform cortex with trypsin irreversibly removes the NMDA responses normally present without significant effect on responses to kainate or quisqualate. These data indicate that the NMDA receptor has a trypsin-sensitive component which is necessary for agonist recognition or ion channel activation.
