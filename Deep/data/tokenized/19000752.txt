AIM OF THE STUDY: Traditional Chinese herb Dihuang Yinzi (DY) is well known to treat neurological diseases by traditional Chinese medical practitioners. This study is to elucidate its neuroprotective and anti-dementia role in ischemic brain injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effects of DY on the pathohistological changes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, Morris water maze task, expression of synaptophysin (SYP) and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) of hippocampi of rats with ischemic brain injury were investigated. RESULTS: This study showed that DY not only significantly decreased the number of TUNEL-positive cells but also reduced the LDH release of hippocampus of model rat. Morris water maze test showed that the ability of learning and memory of rats dramatically impaired after ischemic brain injury. However, DY ameliorated the impairment of learning and memory of ischemic rats. Furthermore, western blotting and immunohistochemical data showed that the expression of extracellular regulated protein and synaptophysin, which correlates with synaptic formation and function, decreased after ischemic insult. However, DY inhibited the reduction of ERK an SYP expression in a dose-dependent way. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that DY possesses neuroprotective and anti-dementia properties, at least in part, by preventing the loss of neural cells and synapses in ischemic brain injury.
