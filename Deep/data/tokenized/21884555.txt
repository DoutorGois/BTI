Permanent, stepwise occlusion of the vertebral arteries (VAs) and internal carotid arteries (ICAs) following the sequence VA-->ICA-->ICA, with an interstage interval (ISI, -->) of 7 days, has been investigated as a four-vessel occlusion (4-VO)/ICA model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. This model has the advantage of not causing retinal damage. In young rats, however, 4-VO/ICA with an ISI of 7 days fails to cause behavioral sequelae. We hypothesized that such a long ISI would allow the brain to efficiently compensate for cerebral hypoperfusion, preventing the occurrence of cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration. The present study evaluated whether brain neurodegeneration and learning/memory deficits can be expressed by reducing the length of the ISI and whether aging influences the outcome. Young, male Wistar rats were subjected to 4-VO/ICA with different ISIs (5, 4, 3 or 2 days). An ISI of 4 days was used in middle-aged rats. Ninety days after 4-VO/ICA, the rats were tested for learning/memory impairment in a modified radial maze and then examined for neurodegeneration of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Regardless of the ISI, young rats were not cognitively impaired, although hippocampal damage was evident. Learning/memory deficits and hippocampal and cortical neurodegeneration occurred in middle-aged rats. The data indicate that 4-VO/ICA has no impact on the capacity of young rats to learn the radial maze task, despite 51% hippocampal cell death. Such resistance is lost in middle-aged animals, for which the most extensive neurodegeneration observed in both the hippocampus and cerebral cortex may be responsible.
