The effect of a single intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of alpha-IFN on levels of central monoamines and their metabolites in six brain regions (frontal cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, hippocampus, mid brain and medulla) of the rat was investigated. Wistar rats (n=10) were decapitated 2 h after i.c.v. injection of alpha-IFN. The brain tissues were homogenized, and monoamine concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with an electrochemical detector. The levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) were significantly reduced in the frontal cortex in a dose-dependent manner, and the levels of both 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were reduced in the mid brain and the striatum. The levels of noradrenaline (NA) were also significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner in the frontal cortex. Some neurophysiological changes that affect activity of the noradrenergic or/and the serotonergic neuron system may occur during IFN therapy.
