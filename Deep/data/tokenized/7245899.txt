Static and dynamic characteristics of unit responses to single and multiple clicks and diffuse light flashes were studied in neurones of CA1 field of the dorsal hippocampus in alert, loosely fixed rabbits. The recorded neurones were characterized by specificity of sensory inputs, selectivity and plastic reorganizations of reactions. Validity of Sokolov model of plastic convergence for neurones of CA1 field and functional significance of the output signal of CA1 field in the system of control of activation processes in OR are discussed.
