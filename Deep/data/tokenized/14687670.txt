A novel version of the 8-arm radial maze task was developed to quantify spatial learning and memory in rats subjected to transient cerebral ischemia (TCI) using the 4-VO model. This maze uses the rat's natural behavior of avoiding open, illuminated areas, and preference for a darkened, enclosed shelter. Ischemic rats were required to escape from the central area into the darkened goal box. Ischemia was induced before or after training to examine its influence on acquisition and retention of cognition, respectively. During the acquisition test, latency of ischemic rats to find the goal box, and working memory performance were significantly impaired (P < 0.005-0.001). The performance for retention of cognition was also disrupted by ischemia (P < 0.05-0.01). There was no correlation between the degree of CA1 pyramidal cell loss and behavioral deficits. The present data reveal that the aversive version of the 8-arm radial maze is sensitive to the cognitive effects of ischemia. Since it excludes the need for food deprivation or immersion of the animal in water, the method should provide a sensitive and more practical behavioral test with which to evaluate the effects of ischemic brain damage on cognition.
