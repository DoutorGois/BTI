We investigated the distribution of the glucose transporter protein within the microvessels in the mouse hippocampus by immunohistochemical methods with an anti-rat brain glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1) and confocal laser scanning microscopy. All intraparenchymal microvessels in the hippocampus showed intensive immunoreactivity and a heterogeneous distribution of GLUT-1 was seen in the microvessels. These data may suggest that glucose could be heterogeneously incorporated into the endothelial cells of the cerebral microvessels, and therefore morphological and physiological differences may be present among the endothelial cells.
