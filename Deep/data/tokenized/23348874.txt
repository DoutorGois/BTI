Prunella vulgaris var. lilacina is widely distributed in Korea, Japan, China, and Europe, and it has been traditionally used to treat inflammation or hypertension. In the present study, we investigated the effects of the ethanolic extract of the spikes of Prunella vulgaris var. lilacina (EEPV) on dizocilpine (MK-801)-induced schizophrenia-like phenotype behaviors such as the disruption of prepulse inhibition and attention deficits in mice. We also determined the effect of EEPV on MK-801-induced alterations in phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase, phosphorylated protein kinase B, phospho-glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta, and phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein levels in the cortex and hippocampus of mice. MK-801-induced prepulse inhibition deficits were ameliorated by the administration of EEPV, as shown in the acoustic startle response test. Furthermore, EEPV attenuated the MK-801-induced attention deficits in the water finding test. We also found that EEPV attenuated the increased phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase, phosphorylated protein kinase B, or phospho-glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta levels induced by MK-801 in the cortex but not in the hippocampus. These results suggest that EEPV could be useful for treating schizophrenia because EEPV ameliorates prepulse inhibition disruption and attention deficits induced by MK-801.
