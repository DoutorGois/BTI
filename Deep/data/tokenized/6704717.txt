A decrease in both choline acetyltransferase (CAT) activity and theta (theta) rhythm were observed in the hippocampal formation of rats implanted with a macroelectrode in the dorsomedial part of the septum. The decrease in CAT activity and in theta occurred simultaneously and in parallel, and there was no instance where the two parameters were uncoupled. These observations suggest that a common neurophysiological mechanism is involved in both CAT activity control and theta rhythm production in the hippocampal formation. From a methodological point of view, these observations should be borne in mind in septohippocampal investigations using septal electrode implantation procedures.
