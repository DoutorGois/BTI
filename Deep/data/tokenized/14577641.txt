GRP94 (glucose regulated protein 94) gene expression in the ischemic-hippocampus of gerbils, which was induced by a temporary occlusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries (CCAs), was tested by Northern blot analysis. The maximum GRP94 gene expression level was detected at the occipital lobe 10 min after the induction of ischemia. In the hippocampus, GRP94 gene expression reached a maximum 15 min after inducing ischemia. Following reperfusion, the maximum expression level was shown at 12 h and continuing thereafter.
