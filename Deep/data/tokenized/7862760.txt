In recent years disturbances in releasing neurotrophic growth factors have been viewed as one of the causes of the development of Alzheimer's disease. It is assumed that abnormalities concerning neurotrophic growth factors (e.g. disturbances in releasing them and (or a wrong response of nerve cells to released growth factors) may be co-responsible for the development of abnormal functions of recent memory or concentration. It is assumed that their role in neurodegenerative processes consists primarily of increasing the survival rate of nerve cells and exerting an effect on the transmitting functions of CNS neurons. Attempts made at present to use growth factors in A.D. with a view to increasing the survival rate of degenerating nerve cells and improving the transmitting functions of neurons will be continued in future in pace with the advancement of our knowledge of their mechanisms.
