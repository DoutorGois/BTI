N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-stimulated [3H]noradrenaline release from rat hippocampal slices was blocked stereospecifically and non-competitively by MK-801 with the (+)-isomer achieving 50% blockade of 100 microM NMDA at 16 nM. The results indicate that MK-801 is the most potent NMDA antagonist yet described and that it blocks NMDA-stimulated neurotransmitter release by an action at the so-called 'phencyclidine (PCP) site'.
