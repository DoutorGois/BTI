Long-term memory, a persistent form of synaptic plasticity, requires translation of a subset of mRNA present in neuronal dendrites during a short and critical period through a mechanism not yet fully elucidated. Western blotting analysis revealed a high content of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) in the brain of neonatal rats, a period of intense neurogenesis rate, differentiation and synaptic establishment, when compared to adult rats. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that eIF5A is present in the whole brain of adult rats showing a variable content among the cells from different areas (e.g. cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum). A high content of eIF5A in the soma and dendrites of Purkinje cells, key neurons in the control of motor long-term memory in the cerebellum, was observed. Detection of high eIF5A content was revealed in dendritic varicosities of Purkinje cells. Evidence is presented herein that a reduction of eIF5A content is associated to brain aging.
