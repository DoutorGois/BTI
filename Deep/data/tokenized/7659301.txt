The changes in the spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) after transient cerebral ischemia were studied using whole-cell recording from CA1 pyramidal neurons in the gerbil. In neurons recorded 1-2 days after ischemia, sEPSCs had a slowed time course with the decay time constant fitted by a single exponential and it progressively increased after ischemia. Frequency and amplitude distribution of sEPSCs in ischemic neurons were not significantly different from those in the control neurons. The results support the view that abnormal non-N-methyl-D-aspartic acid currents originate at the degenerated postsynaptic site, unrelated to the presynaptic releasing mechanisms.
