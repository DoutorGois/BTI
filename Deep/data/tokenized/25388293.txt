RATIONALE: Current anti-depressants are clinically effective only after several weeks of administration and always produce side effects. OBJECTIVES: WY14643 is a selective agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha with neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects. Here, we investigated the anti-depressant effects of WY14643 in mice models of depression. METHODS: We assessed the anti-depressant effects of WY14643 in the forced swim test (FST), tail suspension test (TST) and chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) model. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry studies were further performed to detect the effects of WY14643 on the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling pathway and hippocampal neurogenesis. The anti-BDNF antibody, BDNF signaling inhibitor, and tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor were also used to explore the anti-depressant mechanisms of WY14643. RESULTS: WY14643 exhibited robust anti-depressant effects in the FST and TST and also protected against the CSDS stress in mice models. Moreover, WY14643 reversed the stress-induced elevation of corticosterone, deficiency of BDNF signaling pathway, and hippocampal neurogenesis. Blockade of BDNF signaling cascade, not the monoaminergic system, abolished all the anti-depressant effects of WY14643. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide the first evidence that WY14643 exerts anti-depressant-like activity through promoting the BDNF signaling pathway.
