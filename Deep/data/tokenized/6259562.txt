Low-stimulus frequencies released both D-[3H]aspartate and [14C]GABA in double labelling experiments after activation of the commissural fibres to stratum oriens in hippocampal slices. The stimulus-dependent release of [14C]GABA was highest at low stimulus frequencies (10 Hz) whereas at higher stimulus frequencies (30--50 Hz) it was almost abolished. All stimulus frequencies used released D-[3H]aspartate. The results indicate that activation of the commissural fibres in stratum oriens, using low stimulus frequencies, activates pyramidal cells which stimulate inhibitory neurones releasing GABA as a transmitter.
