Specific [3H]bradykinin(BK) binding was investigated in membranes from guinea-pig brain. In kinetic experiments, specific [3H]BK binding (100 pM) reached equilibrium within 15 min at 25 degrees C (k + 1 = 1.40 nM-1min-1) and the binding was reversed by the addition of 1 microM BK (k-1 = 0.069 min-1). The presence of a high affinity BK binding site was also revealed in the guinea-pig brain by equilibrium saturation studies with a Kd value of 75 pM and a Bmax value of 4.9 +/- 0.9 fmol/mg protein. In inhibition experiments, the B2 antagonists (D-Phe7-BK and Thi5,8,D-Phe7-BK) inhibited [3H]BK binding, but not the B1 antagonist (des-Arg9[Leu8]-BK). D-Arg[Hyp3, D-Phe7]BK (B4801) showed a pseudo Hill coefficient of less than one. The KH and KL values are 1.8 and 94 nM. The regional distribution study shows the highest density of BK binding sites in the pons + medulla oblongata and the spinal cord, a moderate density in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and a low density in other brain regions. These data support the presence of B2 BK receptors in the guinea-pig brain and spinal cord and suggest the existence of B2 subtypes in the brain. The presence of these receptors suggests that BK acts as a neurotransmitter or a neuromodulator in these tissues.
