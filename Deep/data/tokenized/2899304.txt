Embryonic habenular or striatal cholinergic tissues were transplanted to the hippocampal formation of adult rats. The connectivity of these grafts with the host hippocampal formation was analysed using acetylcholinesterase histochemistry and immunocytochemistry with a monoclonal antibody to choline acetyltransferase. Both graft types produced laminar arrangements of acetylcholinesterase-positive fibers in the hippocampal formation that closely resembled the native pattern of cholinergic innervation. In addition, graft-derived choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive synapses were found in the host hippocampal formation. These synapses were formed on non-immunoreactive dendritic structures and were similar to the types of cholinergic synapses found in the hippocampal formation of normal animals. These data indicate that the cholinergic transmitter phenotype is a major determinant of whether a neuron will form typical cholinergic synapses with hippocampal targets.
