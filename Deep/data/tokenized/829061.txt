A frequency analyzer and a biointegrator were used to study the effect of kryptopyrrole (20, 60 or 90 mg/kg) on the cortical and various subcortical structures in cat experiments. It was found that, as regards the subcortical structures, kryptopyrrole primarily causes significant bioelectric changes in the regions of the hippocampus and amygdala; its effects in the cortex are much less marked. In the second hour of the experiment, excitation appears in the behaviour of the cats, simultaneously with an increase in area of the slow frequency regions, where-as after 4-5 hours a considerable behaviour-inhibition can be observed simultaneously with a decrease in area of the slow wave range. The experimental data confirm the behaviour-active effect of kryptopyrrole. The findings indicate that the effect of kryptopyrrole is exerted in two phases. The neurophysiological data obtained give an explanation for these contradictory behaviour changes.
