Using alpha- and beta- tubulin cDNA Probes and Northern blot hybridization technique, we analyzed the effect of intraperitoneally injected Qingyangshen (QYS), a traditional Chinese medicine with antiepileptic property, and diphenylhydrantoin sodium (DPH) on hippocampal alpha- and beta-tubulin gene expression during kainic acid (KA) induced chronic seizures. It was found that: 1) thirty days after intraperitoneal injection of KA, alpha- and beta-tubulin mRNAs in animals showing chronic seizures increased 3.02 +/- 1.05 and 4.07 +/- 1.32 times respectively compared with control; 2) neither QYS (15 mg/kg, q.o.d. x 6) nor DPH (50 mg/kg, q.o.d. x 6), when used separately, could inhibit the above mentioned effect of KA; 3) when QYS (15 mg/kg, q.o.d. x 6) and DPH (50 mg/kg, q.o.d. x 6) were given in combination, the long-term increase in tubulin gene expression induced by KA was significantly reduced, with alpha- and beta-tubulin mRNAs being decreased to 0.44 +/- 0.08 and 0.50 x 0.10 times of corresponding values in animals treated with KA alone. The results indicate that the mechanism of antiepileptic effect of QYS is at least partially related to the inhibition of tubulin synthesis and subsequent reduction in mossy fiber sprouting and neosynaptogenesis.
