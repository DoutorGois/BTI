The anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala and hippocampus form part of an interconnected prefrontal neocortical and limbic archicortical network that is dysregulated in major depressive disorders (MDD). Modulation of this prefrontal-limbic network (PLN) is principally through the hypothalamus, basal ganglia and midbrain. Here the likely mechanisms by which these modulations are affected are described and the implications of their failure for depression associated with suicidal diathesis, late-life and psychoses discussed.
