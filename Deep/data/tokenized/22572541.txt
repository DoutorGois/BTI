Alzheimer's disease is confirmed at autopsy according to the accumulation of brain neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Neuritic plaques contain amyloid-beta (Abeta) and lower levels of Abeta correspond to an increase in ADAM10 alpha-secretase activity. ADAM10 alpha-secretase activity produces a soluble amyloid precursor protein (APP) alpha (sAPPalpha) product and negates the pathological production of Abeta. In this investigation, it was hypothesized that genetic variation with the ADAM10 promoter is associated with ADAM10 expression levels as well as cerebrospinal fluid sAPPalpha levels. Results from this investigation suggest that the ADAM10 rs514049-rs653765 C-A promoter haplotype is associated with: (1) higher CSF sAPPalpha levels in cognitively normal controls compared with Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, (2) higher postmortem brain hippocampus, but not cerebellum, ADAM10 protein levels in subjects with low plaque scores compared with those with high plaque scores, and (3) higher promoter activity for promoter-only reporter constructs compared with promoter 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) constructs in the human neuroblastoma SHSY5Y cell line, but not in HepG2 or U118 cell lines. Taken together, these findings suggest that ADAM10 expression is modulated according to a promoter haplotype that is influenced in a brain region- and cell type-specific manner.
