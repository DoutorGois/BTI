It has been recently reported that potassium channel increases activities in CA1 pyramidal neurons of rat hippocampus following transient forebrain ischemia. To understand the role of the enhanced potassium current in the pathogenesis of neuronal damage after ischemia, we examined the effects of tetraethylammonium (TEA) and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) on the neuronal injury of CA1 region induced by 15 min forebrain ischemia using a four-vessel occlusion model. Adult rats received intracerebroventricular administration of either TEA or 4-AP after ischemia or TEA before ischemia and once each day for 7 days. In the postischemic TEA treated-rats, the neuronal injury in hippocampal CA1 region was significantly less than that of the controls. In contrast, neither preischemic infusion of TEA nor postischemic treatment of 4-AP had any neuroprotective effects. The present study demonstrates that postischemic application of TEA protects hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons against ischemic insult, suggesting that potassium channels may play important roles in the pathogenesis of CA1 neuronal death after transient forebrain ischemia.
