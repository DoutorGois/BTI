The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of the peripheral administration of ghrelin, a peptide hormone secreted from the stomach, on cellular proliferation and differentiation of progenitor cells in the adult hippocampus. Double immunohistochemical staining revealed that Ki-67-positive hippocampal progenitor cells expressed ghrelin receptors. In mice treated with ghrelin (80 microg/kg, i.p.) for 8 days, bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and doublecortin-positive neuroblasts were significantly increased in the dentate subgranular zone. We also found that the numbers of bromodeoxyuridine- and doublecortin-immunoreactive cells were significantly reduced after anti-ghrelin antibody (10 microg/kg, i.p.) treatment for 8 days. Therefore, our results indicate that ghrelin induces proliferation and differentiation of adult hippocampal progenitors, suggesting an involvement of ghrelin in hippocampal neurogenesis.
