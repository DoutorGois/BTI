The excitatory amino acid (EAA), L-cysteine sulfinic acid (L-CSA), elicited a dose-dependent increase in cAMP accumulation in adult rat hippocampus that was not blocked by ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists. Therefore, the possibility was examined that L-CSA activates the (1S,3R)-amino-1,3-cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid (1S,3R-ACPD)-sensitive metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) that increases cAMP by potentiating responses elicited by adenosine or other agonists of receptors coupled to adenylate cyclase via Gs. Like 1S,3R-ACPD, L-CSA induced a cAMP response that was inhibited by the adenosine receptor antagonist, 8-para-sulfyltheophylline, and by adenosine deaminase. In contrast to the 1S,3R-ACPD-induced cAMP response, the L-CSA-induced response was not potentiated by the adenosine uptake inhibitor, dipyridamole. Taken together with the previous finding that L-CSA does not potentiate cAMP responses elicited by agonists of receptors that activate Gs, these data suggest that L-CSA increases cAMP accumulation by activating a metabotropic EAA receptor that is different from the 1S,3R-ACPD-sensitive mGluR associated with potentiation of cAMP responses.
