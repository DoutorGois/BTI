An increase in medial perforant synaptic strength can be observed for hippocampal slices from rats exposed to environmental enrichment. The expression of enhanced synaptic strength exhibits properties similar to long-term potentiation (LTP), a physiological model of memory storage. Similarities include an increase in strength of the synaptic response in the absence of an altered paired-pulse ratio and an increase in the binding of the glutamate agonist alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate. Furthermore, environmental enrichment interacts with the mechanisms responsible for the induction of LTP by inhibiting further increases in synaptic strength following LTP-inducing stimulation. The results provide evidence for experience-mediated influences on postsynaptic mechanisms regulating medial perforant path synaptic strength.
