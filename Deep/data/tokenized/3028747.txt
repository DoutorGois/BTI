The effects of 6 months' ethanol consumption by mice on hippocampal GABAergic neurons were investigated by means of an immunocytochemical method using GABA antibodies. Although ethanol treatment did not modify body or brain weights in our experimental conditions, two differences were observed in ethanol-treated mice, as compared to controls: a decrease in the labelling intensity of immunopositive neurons and fibers in the dorsal and the ventral parts of the hippocampus; and a decrease in the number of immunopositive neurons. This neuronal loss was statistically significant in the ventral hippocampus only, where it reached about 25% in the stratum radiatum. It is concluded that chronic ethanol consumption leads to a decrease in GABA content of hippocampal neurons and to a loss of GABAergic neurons, mostly in the ventral part of the hippocampus. These alterations in GABAergic transmission could be related to the well known functional deficits observed in chronic alcoholism.
