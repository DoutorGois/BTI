Inducible cyclooxygenase 2 (COX 2) converts arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, which are thought to mediate various peripheral lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced central effects, including generation of fever and activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. To localize prostaglandin production in the brain following peripheral LPS administration, COX 2 mRNA expression was examined by in situ hybridization histochemistry in rats injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) or intravenously (i.v.) with various doses of LPS or saline. Constitutive expression of COX 2 mRNA was found in neurons of cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, but not in cells of the blood vessels. COX 2 mRNA levels were not altered in saline-injected animals as compared to non-injected controls. In LPS-injected animals, no consistent changes of neuronal COX 2 mRNA expression were observed. COX 2 mRNA expression appeared ex novo at 0.5-h post-injection in cells closely associated with blood vessels, however, ex novo labeling of the number of labeled cells increased to a peak at 2 h and subsided gradually to basal levels by 24 h. Initially, labeling was observed in cells comprising major surface-lying blood vessels and meninges. Later, vascular and perivascular cells associated with smaller penetrating blood vessels were labeled. This pattern of COX 2 mRNA induction is independent of the route and dose of the LPS injection. The induced COX 2 mRNA producing cells are identified as endothelial and leptomeningeal cells. Changes in COX 2 mRNA expression were not observed in circumventricular organs. These results suggest that peripheral LPS induces a rapid increase in COX 2 production throughout the vasculatures of the brain, which could affect the neuronal activity of widespread brain regions by elevating the levels of prostaglandins.
