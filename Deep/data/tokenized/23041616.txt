PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Here, we discuss the recent data on the role of different N-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) coagonists, D-serine and glycine, in regulating NMDAR activity and neurotoxicity. RECENT FINDINGS: D-Serine originates from both neurons and astrocytes, from where it is released by different mechanisms. Recent data indicate that like glial D-serine, neuronal D-serine is required for NMDAR-dependent, long-term potentiation at the hippocampal CA1-CA3 synapses and proper synapse formation in the cerebral cortex. D-serine is the physiological coagonist of synaptic NMDAR, whereas glycine action is restricted to extrasynaptic sites. SUMMARY: D-Serine is now recognized as the major NMDAR coagonist at the synapse. The data establish D-serine as a key transmitter or neuromodulator that mediates synaptic NMDAR activation and neurotoxicity. In this context, drugs that inhibit D-serine synthesis or release will provide new neuroprotective strategy.
