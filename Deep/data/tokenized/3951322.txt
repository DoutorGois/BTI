In an attempt to kindle seizures with arginine-vasopressin (AVP), we injected AVP into the amygdala or hippocampus of rats. Although behavioral and electrographic alterations were sometimes observed, seizures failed to develop, even in rats that had previously been kindled with electrical stimulation. This and previous failures to kindle seizures by intraventricular injections of AVP call into question the possibility of AVP kindling.
