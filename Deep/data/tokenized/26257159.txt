The objective of this study was to evaluate the toxicity of individual and mixtures of di(n-butyl) phthalates (DBP) and their active metabolite monobutyl phthalate (MBP) and arsenic (As) on spatial cognition associated with hippocampal apoptosis in mice. Mice were exposed, individually or in combination, to DBP (50 mg/kg body weight, intragastrically), MBP (50 mg/kg body weight, intragastrically), and As (10 mg/L, per os) for 8 weeks. The Morris water maze test showed that mice exposed to DBP/MBP combined with As exhibited longer escape latencies and the lower average number of crossing the platform. The As content in the hippocampus after As exposure increased as compared to those without As exposure. In mice exposed to DBP/MBP combined with As, pathological alterations and oxidative damage to the hippocampus were found. Expression of apoptosis-related protein: Bax and caspase-3 were significantly increased in the hippocampus, while there was no significant change in expression of Bcl-2. The results suggested that DBP and MBP combined with As can induce spatial cognitive deficits through altering the expression of apoptosis-related protein and As played a critical role in cognition impairments. And the joint exposure has antagonistic effect.
