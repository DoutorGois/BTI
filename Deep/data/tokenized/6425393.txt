Trimethyltin chloride (TMT) was given to Syrian hamsters, gerbils and marmosets, and the changes in the brain were studied 1 day to 7 weeks later by light and electron microscopy. Within the marmoset brain, TMT was found to be uniformly distributed, similar to that in the rat. In all three species, signs of poisoning included whole-body tremors and prostration, while death might occur in 3-4 days; in marmosets ataxia, agitation, aggression and occasional fits were also observed. Bilateral symmetrical neuronal necrosis and chromatolysis were seen in the majority, which involved the hippocampus, pyriform cortex, amygdaloid nucleus, neocortex, various brain stem nuclei and in marmosets the retina. The probably lethal dose of TMT in all three species is approximately 3 mg kg-1, while the LD50 for the rat is 12.6 mg kg-1. The lower figure is probably related to lack of binding to haemoglobin in contrast to the binding in the rat. TMT does not bind to human haemoglobin and thus the predicted lethal dose for humans may be about 3 mg kg-1 (15.1 mumol kg-1), while the dose required to produce neuronal damage could well be less.
