BACKGROUND: Volatile anesthetic postconditioning has been documented to provide neuroprotection in adult animals. Our aim was to investigate whether sevoflurane postconditioning improves long-term learning and memory of neonatal hypoxia-ischemia brain damage (HIBD) rats, and whether the PI3K/Akt pathway and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening participate in the effect. METHODS: Seven-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to brain HI and randomly allocated to 10 groups (n=24 each group) and treated as follows: (1) Sham, without hypoxia-ischemia; (2) HI/Control, received cerebral hypoxia-ischemia; (3) HI+Atractyloside (Atr), (4) HI+Cyclosporin A (CsA), (5) HI+sevoflurane (Sev), (6) HI+Sev+ LY294002 (LY), (7) HI+Sev+ L-NAME (L-N), (8) HI+Sev+ SB216763 (SB), (9) HI+Sev+Atr, and (10) HI+Sev+CsA. Twelve rats in each group underwent behavioral testing and their brains were harvested for hippocampus neuron count and morphology study. Brains of the other 12 animals were harvested 24h after intervention to examine the expression of Akt, p-Akt, eNOS, p-eNOS, GSK-3beta, p-GSK-3beta by Western bolting and mPTP opening. RESULTS: Sevoflurane postconditioning significantly improved the long-term cognitive performance of the rats, increased the number of surviving neurons in CA1 and CA3 hippocampal regions, and protected the histomorphology of the left hippocampus. These effects were abolished by inhibitors of PI3K/eNOS/GSK-3beta. Although blocking mPTP opening simulated sevoflurane postconditioning-induced neuroprotection, it failed to enhance it. CONCLUSIONS: Sevoflurane postconditioning exerts a neuroprotective effect against HIBD in neonatal rats via PI3K/Akt/eNOS and PI3K/Akt/GSK-3beta pathways, and blockage of mPTP opening may be involved in attenuation of histomorphological injury.
