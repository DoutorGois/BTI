We investigated the gene expression responses using in situ hybridization with radiolabelled riboprobes for the m1 and m3 subtypes of muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the rat hippocampus following a brief (5-min) kainic acid-induced behavioral seizure. The kainic acid was intraperitoneally administered, and the ensuing generalized convulsive seizure terminated with diazepam. Our results demonstrate that the expression of the m1 subtype was significantly reduced in the CA1, CA3 and the dentate granule cells by 3 h after the administration of kainic acid while no significant change was observed in any hippocampal subfield for the m3 subtype. By 6 h post challenge, the m1 subtype was still decreased in all hippocampal subfields examined, while the m3 subtype remained unchanged from vehicle injected control. At 24 h post challenge, both the m1 and m3 subtypes were significantly reduced in the CA1 and CA3 subfields; the expression of the m1 subtype in the dentate granule cells, however, had recovered to levels indistinguishable from vehicle-injected control. These results demonstrate that epileptiform activity induced by kainic acid administration promotes alterations in the expression levels for both the m1 and m3 muscarinic receptor genes, and suggest that the activity of this neuromodulatory system in the hippocampus may be altered through activity-dependent mechanisms at early times following seizures.
