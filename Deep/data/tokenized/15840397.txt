We examined the effect of a free radical scavenger edaravone on ischemia/reperfusion-induced impairment of long-term potentiation in the perforant path-dentate gyrus synapses of the rat hippocampus, as a measure of functional outcome 4 days after transient global ischemia (2-vessel occlusion, 10 min). Edaravone (3 and 10 mg/kg, i.v.) immediately after reperfusion (Day 0) alleviated ischemia-induced impairment of long-term potentiation in a dose-related manner, whereas treatment on Day 1 or 4 after reperfusion failed to rescue the impaired long-term potentiation. Edaravone administration on Day 0 also prevented the post-ischemic increase in hydroxyl radical formation and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor and neuronal and inducible nitric oxide synthases of the hippocampus. Thus, edaravone protected the rat hippocampus from ischemia-induced long-term potentiation impairment with a therapeutic time window, suggesting that free radical formation after ischemia/reperfusion is a pivotal trigger of neurofunctional complications after global ischemic stroke.
