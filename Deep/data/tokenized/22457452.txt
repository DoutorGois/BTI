In vitro studies have repeatedly demonstrated that the neurotransmitters gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine depolarize immature neurons in many areas of the CNS, including the spinal cord. This widely accepted phenomenon was recently challenged by experiments showing that the depolarizing action of GABA on neonatal hippocampus and neocortex in vitro was prevented by adding energy substrates (ES), such as the ketone body metabolite dl-beta-hydroxybutyric acid (DL-BHB), lactate, or pyruvate to the artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). It was suggested that GABA-induced depolarizations in vitro might be an artifact due to inadequate energy supply when glucose is the sole energy source, consistent with the energy metabolism of neonatal rat brain being largely dependent on ESs other than glucose. Here we examined the effects of these ESs (DL-BHB, lactate, pyruvate) on inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) recorded from neonatal rat lumbar spinal cord motoneurons (MNs), in vitro. We report that supplementing the ACSF with physiologic concentrations of DL-BHB, lactate, or pyruvate does not alter the reversal potential of IPSPs (E(IPSP)). Only high concentrations of pyruvate hyperpolarized E(IPSP). In addition, the depolarizing action of GABA on primary afferent terminals was not affected by supplementing the ACSF with ES at physiologic concentrations. We conclude that depolarizing IPSPs in immature MNs and the primary afferent depolarizations are not caused by inadequate energy supply. Glucose at its standard concentration appears to be an adequate ES for the neonatal spinal cord in vitro.
