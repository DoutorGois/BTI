Prematurity and perinatal hypoxia-ischemia are common problems that result in significant neurodevelopmental morbidity and high mortality worldwide. The Vannucci model of unilateral brain injury was developed to model perinatal brain injury due to hypoxia-ischemia. Because the rodent brain is altricial, i.e., it develops postnatally, investigators can model either preterm or term brain injury by varying the age at which injury is induced. This model has allowed investigators to better understand developmental changes that occur in susceptibility of the brain to injury, evolution of brain injury over time, and response to potential neuroprotective treatments. The Vannucci model combines unilateral common carotid artery ligation with a hypoxic insult. This produces injury of the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus, and periventricular white matter ipsilateral to the ligated artery. Varying degrees of injury can be obtained by varying the depth and duration of the hypoxic insult. This chapter details one approach to the Vannucci model and also reviews the neuroprotective effects of erythropoietin (Epo), a neuroprotective treatment that has been extensively investigated using this model and others.
