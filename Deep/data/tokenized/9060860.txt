Electrographic recordings from depth and subdural electrodes, performed in two patients with seizures of mesial temporal origin, were analyzed for the presence of non-linearities in the signal. The correlation integral, a measure sensitive to a wide variety of non-linearities, was used for detection. Statistical significance was determined by comparison of the original signal to surrogate datasets. Statistically significant non-linearities were present in signals generated by the epileptogenic hippocampus and interictal spike foci in the temporal neocortex. Less prominent non-linearities were found in EEG signals generated by more normal areas of the brain. These results indicate that techniques developed for the study of non-linear systems can be used to characterize the epileptogenic regions of the brain during the interictal period and can elucidate the dynamical mechanisms of the epileptic transition.
