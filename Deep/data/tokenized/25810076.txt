gamma oscillations are associated with higher brain functions such as memory, perception and consciousness. Disruption of gamma oscillations occur in various neuro-psychological disorders such as schizophrenia. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) are highly expressed in the hippocampus, however, little is known about the role on hippocampal persistent gamma oscillation. This study examined the effects of nicotine and selective nAChR agonists and antagonists on kainate-induced persistent gamma oscillation in rat hippocampal slices. Nicotine enhanced gamma oscillation at concentrations of 0.1-10 muM, but reduced it at a higher concentration of 100 muM. The enhancement on gamma oscillation can be best mimicked by co-application of alpha4beta2- and alpha7-nAChR agonist and reduced by a combination of nAChR antagonists, DhbetaE and MLA. However, these nAChR antagonists failed to block the suppressing role of nicotine on gamma. Furthermore, we found that the NMDA receptor antagonist D-AP5 completely blocked the effect of nicotine. These results demonstrate that nicotine modulates gamma oscillations via alpha7 and alpha4beta2 nAChR as well as NMDA activation, suggesting that nAChR activation may have a therapeutic role for the clinical disorder such as schizophrenia, which is known to have impaired gamma oscillation and hypo-NMDA receptor function.
