Hyperthermia above a critical threshold results in multisystemic changes that include neurological manifestations of heat stroke. It is unknown if the latter represents an intrinsic thermal sensitivity of the CNS or whether injury is secondary to physiological responses of non-CNS origin. To address this issue, the present work examined functional, structural, and biochemical changes in the CNS of dogs subjected to a thermal dosage immediately below that which induces disseminated intravascular coagulation with secondary multiple organ injury. The experimental approach is previously reported, inducing a 42.5 degrees C, 90 min, whole body hyperthermia while preventing other physiological responses to treatment, including respiratory alkalosis and significant reductions in mean arterial pressure. Functional analyses included neurologic examinations and brainstem auditory evoked potential recordings in the post-treatment interval in both hyperthermic and euthermic control populations. Biochemical and structural analyses examined the expression of 70-kDa heat shock proteins, cytokines, markers of astroglial and microglial injury/activation, evidence of vascular endothelial damage, and evidence of neuronal and axonal injury in brain between 0.5 h and 8 days from the end of the treatment. The only significant change associated with treatment was induction of the major inducible 70-kDa heat shock protein, this being most prominent in the cerebellum with maximal expression at 6 h and a return to baseline by 8 days.Collectively, from these results we suggest that the canine brain is intrinsically resistant to sublethal hyperthermia such that when CNS lesions occur, they do so in the presence of other physiological derangements.
