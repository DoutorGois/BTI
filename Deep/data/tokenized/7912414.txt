The interactive effects of clorgyline, deprenyl and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) on striatal dopamine (DA), serotonin (5HT) and hippocampal norepinephrine (NE) were examined in the present study. Results indicated that clorgyline did not have a preventive effect against MPTP's toxicity on DA and NE, but it had a partial therapeutic effect against subchronic MPTP-induced DA depletion when given with deprenyl together. However, this effect was not significantly different from the effect of deprenyl alone. Co-administration of clorgyline and deprenyl had a satisfactory effect in preventing MPTP-induced NE depletion. On the other hand, in all clorgyline-treated groups, there was a significant increase of 5HT in both the striatum and the hippocampus.
