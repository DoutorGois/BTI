Study investigated neuroutcome in mice subjected at 7-8 d of life to hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HI) followed by 30 min of reoxygenation with 100% O(2) (Re-O(2)) or room air (Re-Air). At 24 h of recovery, mouse reflexes were tested. At 7 wks after HI spatial orientation and memory were assessed in the same mice. Mortality rate was recorded at 24 h and at 7 wks of recovery. In separate cohort of mice, changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) during HI-insult and reoxygenation were recorded. Re-O(2)versus Re-Air mice exhibited significantly delayed geotaxis reflex. Adult Re-O(2)versus Re-Air mice exhibited significantly better spatial learning and orientation with strong tendency toward better preserved memory. Histopathology revealed significantly less hippocampal atrophy in Re-O(2)versus Re-Air mice. Following a hypoxia-induced hypoperfusion, Re-O(2) re-established CBF in the ipsilateral side to the prehypoxic level significantly faster than Re-Air. The mortality was higher among Re-O2 versus Re-Air mice, although, it did not reach statistical significance. Re-O(2)versus Re-Air restores CBF significantly faster and results in better late neuroutcome. However, greater early motor deficit and higher mortality rate among Re-O(2)versus Re-Air mice suggest that Re-O(2) may be deleterious at the early stage of recovery.
