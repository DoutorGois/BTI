The actions of the neurotoxic amino acids folate and kainate have been compared on ortho-and antidromic responses evoked in CA1, CA3 and the dentate gyrus of slices of rat hippocampus maintained in vitro. Both in CA1 and the dentate gyrus superfusion of these acids caused an increase in amplitude of the population spike discharging from an excitatory postsynaptic potential which either remained unaffected or was reduced. In the CA3 region kainate and folate had broadly similar actions to enhance the probability of cell firing to synaptic excitation, and also caused epileptiform discharges to occur spontaneously or in response to electrical stimulation. Spontaneous and evoked population bursts in CA3 did not persist in low calcium/high magnesium medium indicating their dependence on intact synaptic transmission; spontaneously occurring bursts in CA1 were eliminated with the latter treatment or when the axonal connections between it and CA3 were cut. Following folate superfusion the commissural-evoked response in CA3 showed large and variable shifts of the latency which were dependent on the stimulus intensity and its timing after a spontaneous population discharge. Although all of the effects of folate were reproduced by bicuculline, no evidence for a decreased recurrent inhibition in CA1 was obtained although this was observed with kainate. The finding that folate and kainate produced their effects in the absence of a detectable effect on the antidromic population spike suggests a mechanism of action other than neuronal depolarization. The implications of these data for the neurotoxic mechanism(s) and the receptor homologies of folate and kainate are discussed.
