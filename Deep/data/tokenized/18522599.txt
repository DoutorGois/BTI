Studies of epilepsy and memory are tied by their common dependence on the hippocampal formation and the adjacent brain structures in the temporal lobe. With the discovery of adult neurogenesis and the consequent revisions of our understanding of how the hippocampus works, the role of neurogenesis in epilepsy needs to be addressed. In this article, we outline two theories describing how neurogenesis contributes to the hippocampus-dependent learning. We speculate that any drastic changes in neurogenesis will negatively impact the hippocampal memory processing.
