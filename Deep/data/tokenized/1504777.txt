Hippocampal brain slices show CA1 injury similar to that seen after global ischemia in vivo. Cooling rats to 31 degrees C prior to sacrifice or cooling slices to 21 degrees C for 45 min increased the percentage of normal CA1 pyramidal cells after 5 h in vitro from 30% to over 80%. Brain slices also show a unique, consistent injury in dentate which is lessened by transient cooling to 21 degrees C but not by cooling the animal.
