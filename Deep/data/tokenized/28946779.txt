Enhancement of cholinergic function via muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1 agonism improves cognition in some schizophrenia patients. Most atypical antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine and its active metabolite, N-desmethylclozapine, and lurasidone, enhance the release of acetylcholine in key brain regions involved in cognition (e.g. hippocampus). We determined the effect of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1 stimulation on novel object recognition and its contribution to the ability of atypical antipsychotic drugs to reverse the novel object recognition deficit in rats withdrawn from subchronic phencyclidine, a rodent model of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. In control rats, the non-specific muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, scopolamine, and the M1 selective antagonist, VU0255035, induced a novel object recognition deficit, which was reversed by the M1 agonist, AC260584. Scopolamine fully blocked the effect of clozapine and N-desmethylclozapine, but not lurasidone, to restore novel object recognition in subchronic phencyclidine-treated rats. VU0255035 also blocked these effects of clozapine and N-desmethylclozapine, but not lurasidone; however, the blockade was not as complete as that achieved with scopolamine. Furthermore, subchronic phencyclidine increased hippocampal M1 mRNA expression. These data suggest that M1 agonism is required for clozapine and N-desmethylclozapine to ameliorate the phencyclidine-induced deficit in novel object recognition, additional evidence that M1 agonism is a potential target for treating cognitive impairment in schizophrenia.
