The shape of the dendritic arbor is one of the criteria of neuron classification and reflects functional specialization of particular classes of neurons. The development of a proper dendritic branching pattern strongly relies on interactions between the extracellular environment and intracellular processes responsible for dendrite growth and stability. We previously showed that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase is crucial for this process. In this work, we performed a screen for modifiers of dendritic growth in hippocampal neurons, the expression of which is potentially regulated by mTOR. As a result, we identified Cyr61, an angiogenic factor with unknown neuronal function, as a novel regulator of dendritic growth, which controls dendritic growth in a beta1-integrin-dependent manner.
