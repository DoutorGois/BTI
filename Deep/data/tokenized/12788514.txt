Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) functions as a survival factor and disruption of cell-ECM interaction can lead to cell death. Our previous study has demonstrated ischemia-induced enhancement of activity of extracellular metalloproteinases, which might result in the alteration of adhesive contact with ECM and affect the intracellular signaling pathway. The enzyme thought to play a major role in conveying survival signals from ECM to the cell interior is focal adhesion kinase (pp125(FAK)). In the present study, the temporal relation between activation of extracellular metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9), degradation of extracellular matrix protein laminin and the expression of pp125(FAK) after 5 min of global ischemia in gerbil hippocampus were investigated. While significant activation of both investigated metalloproteinases occurred in the course of reperfusion, only changes in MMP-9 activity were correlated with degradation of laminin. These ischemia-induced extracellular events coincide temporarily with proteolytic modification of FAK protein and diminished level of its phosphorylated form, to about 50% of the initial value. These results are indicative of an involvement of ECM-pp125(FAK) signaling pathway in ischemia-induced neuronal degeneration.
