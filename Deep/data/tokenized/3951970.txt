Thermosensitive preoptic and septal (PO/SP) neurons were studied for their responsiveness to electrical stimulation of the dorsal Ammon's horn (DAH) and the ventral subiculum (VSB) of the hippocampal formation in the rat. DAH stimulation affected only 14 (16%) of 90 PO/SP thermosensitive neurons whereas VSB stimulation affected 77 (86%) units. The results suggests that the DAH has no major role in thermoregulation in the rat.
