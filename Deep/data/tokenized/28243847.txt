Pregnant women constitute about half the users of methamphetamine (MA), in whom the consumption may continue during breastfeeding. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of MA use during pregnancy and lactation on the hippocampus of pups. 35 pregnant Wistar rats were divided into seven groups, including three experimental groups daily administered with 5 mg/kg of MA (i.p.) during the prenatal and/or postnatal period (PND1-22). In addition, three sham control groups received normal saline at the same dose, and one normal control group received no interventions since early pregnancy until the end of lactation. After the interventions, two pups (aged one and 22 days) were randomly selected from each mother and their brain tissue sections were prepared to determine the expression of PSA-NCAM molecules and sialic acids using immunohistochemical and lectinhistochemical techniques, respectively. In one-day infant rats with MA exposure during pregnancy, a significant decrease was observed in the number of PSA-NCAM positive cells in the CA1 (P = 0.047), CA3 (P = 0.05) and DG (P = 0.006) hippocampus regions compared to control and expression intensity of these molecules in all the three regions (P </= 0.05). Moreover, in 22-day pups with MA exposure during pregnancy and lactation, number of PSA-NCAM positive cells and expression intensity of these molecules significantly reduced in all the three regions of the hippocampus (P </= 0.05). Findings regarding the intensity of sialic acid expression were aligned with PSA-NCAM expression. According to our results, MA administration during pregnancy and lactation may effect on polysialic acid-neural cell adhesion molecule expression in rat's offspring hippocampus.
