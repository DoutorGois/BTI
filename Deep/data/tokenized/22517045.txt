This review focuses on the examination of the fetal brain, using three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound and the multiplanar rendering mode (MPR). The routine examination of the brain is achieved with axial planes but a dedicated fetal neurosonogram requires additional coronal and sagittal views, in order to provide a complete view of the different brain structures. Because these planes are difficult to obtain under many conditions, the present paper shows how 3D MPR allows one to obtain 1 or multiple reconstructed images from a digital volume. The display can be either as orthogonal planes, tomographic planes with parallel slices or as one single plane of the region of interest, which can be selected by the examiner. This approach allows easily the demonstration of the corpus callosum, the cerebellar vermis, the three-horn view, the foetal hippocampus and other regions. In addition, early neurosonography of the developing brain from the 7th week of pregnancy onwards can be achieved.
