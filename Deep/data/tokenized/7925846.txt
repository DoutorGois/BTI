In the study of the central nervous system, it is necessary to address mechanisms by which cells are injured. In vitro investigations using cells in culture allow sharply focused mechanistic questions to be addressed; however, these studies have often been limited by the sensitivity constraints of assays. Many assays for oxidative products require large amounts of cells that must be disrupted. The extent of oxidation in individual cells is therefore unknown and the results yield an average among different cell types. This is inconvenient in cultures of the nervous system which often have multiple cell types. Using a newly developed method for visualizing oxidation products in individual cells, we have examined oxidation in neurons in culture. The method uses a hydrazide, biotin-4-amidobenzoic hydrazide, to bind carbonyls generated from oxidation. Biotin is detected by streptavidin conjugated with a fluorescent dye. Neurons in culture were exposed to 0.1 to 100 microM ferrous sulfate and fluorescence was visualized and quantitated using confocal laser microscopy. Low levels of oxidation (0.1 microM ferrous sulfate) were easily detected with this method. Iron concentration and fluorescence intensity correlated highly (r = 0.991). As an indicator of the sensitivity of this new method, carbonyl content in the cultures was also quantitated using the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine assay (DNPH). The DNPH assay failed to detect the low levels of oxidation which were detected by the biotin-4-amidobenzoic hydrazide method. Fluorescence intensity partially paralleled loss of neuronal viability. Low concentrations of iron (0.1 and 1.0 microM) did not produce significant neuronal death; however, higher concentrations (10 and 100 microM) produced 19 and 53% neuronal loss, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
