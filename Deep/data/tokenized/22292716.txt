Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a neuroactive protein produced in most brain cell types and participates in regulation of cerebral blood flow and blood pressure. In addition to its vascular effects, ET-1 affects synaptic and nonsynaptic neuronal and glial functions. Direct application of ET-1 to the hippocampus of immature rats results in cerebral ischemia, acute seizures, and epileptogenesis. Here, we investigated whether ET-1 itself modifies the excitability of hippocampal and cortical circuitry and whether acute seizures observed in vivo are due to nonvascular actions of ET-1. We used acute hippocampal and cortical slices that were preincubated with ET-1 (20 muM) for electrophysiological recordings. None of the slices preincubated with ET-1 exhibited spontaneous epileptic activity. The slope of the stimulus intensity-evoked response (input-output) curve and shape of the evoked response did not differ between ET-1-pretreated and control groups, suggesting no changes in excitability after ET-1 treatment. The threshold for eliciting an evoked response was not significantly increased in either hippocampal or cortical regions when pretreated with ET-1. Our data suggest that acute seizures after intrahippocampal application of ET-1 in rats are likely caused by ischemia rather than by a direct action of ET-1 on brain tissue.
