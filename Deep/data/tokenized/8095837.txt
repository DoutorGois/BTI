The calcium channel antagonists verapamil nifedipine and flunarizine all increased the threshold for convulsions induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate in rats. By contrast, only flunarizine blocked the long-term serotonin-depleting effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine. Flunarizine was also the only drug that antagonized methamphetamine-induced stereotypy. These findings suggest that calcium influx through L-type channels does not participate in the neurotoxic mechanism of MDMA, and that the neuroprotective actions of flunarizine are probably related to its anti-dopaminergic activity.
