In this issue of Neuron, two studies by Pielage et al. and Bednarek and Caroni suggest that the cytoskeleton regulator beta-Adducin provides an activity-dependent switch controlling synapse disassembly and assembly at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and the mouse hippocampus. In mice, the beta-Adducin switch is required for the improvement of learning and memory induced by enriched environments.
