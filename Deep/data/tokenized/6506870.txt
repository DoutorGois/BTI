Intact rats and rats with lesions of the hippocampus and septum were trained to repeated switching-over of the habit of choosing the reinforced side of the maze as well as to alternation of reinforced side choice. Repeated switchings-over of the habit impedes the subsequent elaboration of the choice alternation ("negative transfer"). In operated animals, the interferating effect of the previous experience is more expressed. The observed deficit of training is due to disturbance in the apparatus limiting the process of search and retrieval of adequate information from the memory.
