Using in vivo microdialysis, we examined the effect of intraperitoneal injection of reserpine (2 mg/kg) on hippocampal 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (MHPG) and 3,4-dihydroxy-phenylacetic acid (DOPAC), two major metabolites of catecholamine. Responses were examined serially for 12 h in the hippocampus of walking-stress-induced depression-model rats, recovery rats and control rats. Control rats showed a rapid rise followed by a gradual fall of free and total MHPG and a delayed increase of DOPAC in response to reserpine. Depression-model rats showed a significantly blunted biphasic response of free and total MHPG as well as blunted monophasic response of DOPAC compared with control rats. Recovery rats also exhibited a blunted fall response of MHPG. Our findings suggest that the vesicle membrane in the central noradrenaline (NA) neurons could be hyposensitive to reserpine in the depression-model rats.
