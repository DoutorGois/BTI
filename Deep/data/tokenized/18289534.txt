Clinical evidence and animal models indicate greater brain damage in newborn males following injury. In adults, glutamate is the primary source of excitotoxic cell death and the steroid, estradiol, is neuroprotective. In neonatal brain, membrane depolarization following activation of GABAA receptors is the major source of excitation. Consequent influx of calcium via L-type channels is normally trophic, but becomes excitotoxic during periods of excessive activation of GABAA receptors, such as hypoxia-ischemia, alcohol exposure and seizures. The use of sex-specific hippocampal cultures revealed greater cell death induced by the GABAA agonist, muscimol, in male- versus female-derived cultures. Pretreatment with the androgen, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) increased muscimol-induced death in both sexes. Exploration of calcium dynamics indicated that, counter to expectation, female neurons achieved higher [Ca2+]i than male, but the calcium transient duration was shorter due to faster rise and decay. However, a second exposure to muscimol within minutes of the first, caused significant attenuation of [Ca2+]i in female neurons. In contrast, while male neurons exposed to muscimol for the first time exhibited lower maximal [Ca2+]i, when exposed to muscimol again there was no attenuation in [Ca2+]i. The latter effect was induced in females by DHT, and inversely correlated with the amount of gamma2 subunit of the GABAA receptor. This novel effect of androgen on GABA-mediated excitotoxicty suggests a unique opportunity for a sex-specific therapeutic approach involving antagonism of the androgen receptor in neonatal males at risk for brain injury.
