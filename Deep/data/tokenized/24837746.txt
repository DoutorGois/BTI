The recognition memory tasks, novel object and novel object location, have been beneficial to neuroendocrine research concerning the effects of gonadal and adrenal hormones on cognitive function. This review discusses the advantages of these tasks in comparison with other learning and memory tasks. Experiments conducted across a number of laboratories show that gonadal hormones, both estradiol and testosterone, promote memory while the adrenal hormone, corticosterone, impairs memory. The effects of these steroid hormones on spine density in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus are also briefly presented. Overall, results show that these steroid hormones are potent modulators of memory consolidation in rodent models.
