Behavioral dissociations on tests of cognitive abilities are powerful tools that can help define the neuropsychology of developmentally disabling conditions. Animals gestationally exposed to alcohol demonstrate spatial (place) but not object (cue) memory impairments. Whether children with fetal alcohol syndrome demonstrate a similar dissociation has received little attention. In this experiment, 30 Native American children, 15 previously identified with fetal alcohol syndrome and 15 control children, were asked to recall places and objects in a task previously shown to be sensitive to memory skills in individuals with and without mental retardation. As in animal models, children with fetal alcohol syndrome demonstrated a spatial but not an object memory impairment. A possible role for the hippocampus was discussed.
