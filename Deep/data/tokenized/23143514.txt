We found that medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in both the direct and indirect pathways of the mouse nucleus accumbens (NAc) receive inputs from the cortex, thalamus and hippocampus. However, hippocampal inputs were much weaker onto indirect MSNs, where they contacted small spines located in the distal dendrites. This selective targeting means that these inputs must be gated by subthreshold depolarization to trigger action potentials and influence NAc output.
