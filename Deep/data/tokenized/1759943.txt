Several series of experiments were designed to compare the effects of selective lesions of the fimbria or of thalamic nuclei on three different tasks involving working memory in rats: object recognition, place recognition, and the radial arm maze test. The main effects of fimbria lesions were as follows: they produced deficits in the radial maze; object recognition was spared or even facilitated, whereas place recognition was impaired. Electrolytic lesions of either centromedian-parafascicularis (CM-Pf) or dorsomedialis (DM) nuclei produced highly significant deficits in the radial maze test but spared object and place recognition. Ibotenate lesions of the CM-Pf had no effect on any test, which means that the critical structure in the effects of the electrolytic lesions of the CM-Pf was the fasciculus retroflexus (FR). These data may contribute two main points to animal models of hippocampal and thalamic amnesia: (1) different forms of working memory in rats might have different neural bases and (2) the FR may be involved in learning and memory processes.
