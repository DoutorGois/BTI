The environmental contaminants methylmercury (MeHg) and mercuric chloride (HgCl2) stimulated the spontaneous release of [3H]noradrenaline ([3H]NA) from hippocampal slices in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Both MeHg and HgCl2 were similarly potent, with an EC50 of 88.4 microM and 75.9 microM, respectively. The releasing effects of MeHg and HgCl2 increased in the presence of desipramine, showing that the mechanism does not involve reversal of the transmitter transporter, and were completely blocked by reserpine preincubation, indicating a vesicular origin of [3H]NA release. The voltage-gated Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX) did not affect the response to mercury compounds. [3H]NA release elicited by MeHg was partially dependent on extracellular Ca2+, since it decreased significantly in a Ca2+-free EGTA-containing medium whereas HgCl2 induced a release of [3H]NA independent of extracellular Ca2+. Neither Ca2+-channels blockers, cobalt chloride (CoCl2) and (omega-conotoxin-GVIA, nor the Na+/Ca2+-exchanger inhibitor benzamil reduced MeHg-evoked [3H]NA release. Moreover, thapsigargin or caffeine, endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-depletors, did not modify metal-evoked [3H]NA release, whereas ruthenium red, which inhibits the mitochondrial Ca2+ transport, decreased the effect of both MeHg and HgCl2. All these data indicate that, in hippocampal slices, mercury compounds release [3H]NA from the vesicular pool by a mechanism involving Ca2+ mobilization from mitochondrial stores.
