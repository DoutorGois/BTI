Identification of neural stem and progenitor cells (NPCs) in vitro and in vivo is essential to the use of developmental and disease models of neurogenesis. The dog is a valuable large animal model for multiple neurodegenerative diseases and is more closely matched to humans than rodents with respect to brain organization and complexity. It is therefore important to determine whether immunohistochemical markers associated with NPCs in humans and rodents are also appropriate for the dog. The NPC markers CD15, CD133, nestin, GFAP and phosphacan (DSD-1) were evaluated in situ in the canine rostral telencephalon, hippocampal dentate gyrus, and cerebellum at different postnatal time-points. Positive staining results were interpreted in the context of region and cellular morphology. Our results showed that neurospheres and cells within the rostral subventricular zone (SVZ), dentate gyrus subgranular zone (SGZ), and white matter tracts of the cerebellum were immunopositive for CD15, nestin and GFAP. Neurospheres and the cerebellum were immunonegative for CD133, whereas CD133 staining was present in the postnatal rostral SVZ. Anti-phosphacan antibody staining delineated the neurogenic niches of the rostral lateral ventricle SVZ and the hippocampal SGZ. Positive staining for phosphacan was also noted in white matter tracts of the cerebellum and within the Purkinje layer. Our results showed that in the dog these markers were associated with regions shown to be neurogenic in rodents and primates.
