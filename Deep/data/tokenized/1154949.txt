A simple method is presented which by subtraction of amplitudes of averaged evoked potentials (AEP) within regular time-intervals enables us to estimate differences in the course of the potential. First results demonstrate that all parts of the potential may be influenced and that most striking differences must not necessarily occur in the peak region of the AEP. The late negative complex of the AEP is likely to be a result of summation of some subcomponents, which may be altered differently. The method presented allows exact measurements of each of them.
