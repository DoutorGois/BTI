Vestibular information modulates hippocampal activity for spatial processing and place cell firing. However, evidence of a purely vestibular stimulus modulating hippocampal activity is confounded as most studies use stimuli containing somatosensory and visual components. In the present study, high-frequency electrical stimulation of specific vestibular sensory regions of the right labyrinth in anaesthetized guinea pigs induced an evoked field potential in the hippocampal formation bilaterally with a latency of about 40 ms following stimulation onset. Field potentials localized in the hippocampal formation occurred with stimulus current parameters that were too small to produce eye movements. This provides direct electrophysiological evidence of vestibular input to the hippocampus.
