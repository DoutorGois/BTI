The effect of thrombin, an agonist of proteinase-activated receptor (PAR) family, was studied on cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Thrombin in a concentration range of 1 pM - 10 nM induced a transitory dose-dependent increase in intracellular free calcium concentration. Involvement of PAR1 in neural response to thrombin was corroborated in experiments with TFLLRN, a selective synthetic peptide agonist of these receptors. In a calcium-free medium and after treatment with cyclopiazonic acid (inhibitor of Ca(2+)-ATPase in the endoplasmic reticulum) activation of PAR not only mobilized Ca(2+) from intracellular stores, but also induced Ca(2+) entry into the cells. Thrombin decreased Ca(2+) signal triggered by activation of NMDA-subtype glutamate receptors.
