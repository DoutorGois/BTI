Lesions of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injections of 192 IgG-saporin increased the locomotor response to 0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg of D-amphetamine in adult rats [A. Mattsson, S.O. Ogren, L. Olson, Facilitation of dopamine_mediated locomotor activity in adult rats following cholinergic denervation, Exp Neurol. 174 (2002) 96-108.]. In the present study, adult male rats were subjected to bilateral injections of 192 IgG-saporin either into the septum (Sp), the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (Nbm), both structures (SpNbm) or i.c.v. Locomotor activity was assessed in the home cage 23 days after surgery, and, subsequently, thrice after an intraperitoneal injection of D-amphetamine (1 mg/kg) and twice after an injection of cocaine (15 mg/kg). Analysis of AChE-stained material showed that Sp lesions induced preferentially hippocampal denervation, Nbm lesions induced preferentially cortical denervation, while both SpNbm and i.c.v. lesions deprived the hippocampus and the cortex of almost all AChE-positive reaction products. The spontaneous and drug-induced locomotor activity of all lesioned rats did not differ significantly from that of control rats, except in rats subjected to i.c.v. injections, in which the locomotor response was significantly increased after the second administration of cocaine. In addition, in Nbm and SpNbm rats, the locomotor reaction to cocaine was weaker right after the second injection. The present results do not confirm the report by Mattsson et al. on the potentiation of amphetamine-induced locomotion by i.c.v. injections of 192 IgG-saporin, but suggest that cocaine-induced locomotion can be increased by such lesions and, to some respect, attenuated by cholinergic damage in the Nbm.
