The present experiments examined whether cholinergic grafts reverse the physiological and behavioral deficits of the damaged hippocampus. Fimbria-fornix lesions were performed in young rats and 3 months later half of the lesioned rats received cholinergic-rich basal forebrain transplants. Eight months after grafting we tested the animals behaviorally in the water maze. Following the behavioral experiments, the animals were implanted with chronic recording and stimulating electrodes and the electrical properties of the hippocampus, including spontaneous EEG, interictal spikes, evoked responses, long-term potentiation, and sensitivity to induced seizures were examined. Grafted rats did not show statistically reliable behavioral recovery (swim latencies, swim path lengths) and their performance was identical to the lesion-only group. Acetylcholinesterase reinnervation of the host hippocampus in grafted animals was similar to intact rats; the grafts also contained numerous parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons. The most striking physiological change was the significant elevation of seizure threshold in the grafted group, but other physiological parameters did not improve consistently. The findings suggest that the presence of septal tissue grafts and restoration of cholinergic reinnervation in animals with previous subcortical denervation of the hippocampus are not sufficient to restore normal hippocampal electrical patterns or to improve behavioral performance.
