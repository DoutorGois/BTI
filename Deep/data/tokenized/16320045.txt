Potentiation of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor function has been proposed as being useful in the treatment of depression, but thus far, little is known about the possible changes in AMPA receptor expression in the brain, after antidepressant treatment. The present study was carried out to study the expression of AMPA receptor subunits in different brain regions of mice that had been chronically injected with maprotiline. The latter is a modified tricyclic antidepressant that functions as a noradrenaline uptake inhibitor. Daily intraperitoneal injection with 10 mg/kg maprotiline for 30 days resulted in significantly increased GluR1 and GluR2/3 subunit expression in the nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum as detected by immunohistochemistry; and significantly increased GluR1 and GluR2/3 expression in the hippocampus, as demonstrated by Western blot analysis. No change, or a decrease in GluR2 expression was detected in all the brain regions by both immunohistochemistry and Western blots. The increase in GluR1 and GluR2/3, but no increase in GluR2 subunits suggests that there could be an increase in calcium permeability of AMPA receptors in limbic/striatal brain regions after maprotiline treatment. This could lead to increased synaptic activity or plasticity in the hippocampus and striatum, and may underlie the therapeutic effect of maprotline, and possibly, other antidepressant drugs.
