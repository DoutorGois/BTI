OBJECTIVE: Characterize glutamate neurotransmission in the hippocampus of awake-behaving rodents during focal seizures in a model of aging. METHODS: We used enzyme-based ceramic microelectrode array technology to measure in vivo extracellular tonic glutamate levels and real-time phasic glutamate release and clearance events in the hippocampus of awake Fischer 344 rats. Local application of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) into the CA1 region was used to induce focal motor seizures in different animal age groups representing young, late-middle aged and elderly humans. RESULTS: Rats with the highest preseizure tonic glutamate levels (all in late-middle aged or elderly groups) experienced the most persistent 4-AP-induced focal seizure motor activity (wet dog shakes) and greatest degree of acute seizure-associated disruption of glutamate neurotransmission measured as rapid transient changes in extracellular glutamate levels. SIGNIFICANCE: Increased seizure susceptibility was demonstrated in the rats with the highest baseline hippocampal extracellular glutamate levels, all of which were late-middle aged or aged animals. The manifestation of seizures behaviorally was associated with dynamic changes in glutamate neurotransmission. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a relationship between seizure susceptibility and alterations in both baseline tonic and phasic glutamate neurotransmission.
