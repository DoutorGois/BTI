In Mongolian gerbils, the content of vasopressin in the cerebral cortex, the striatum, and the hypothalamus is increased after induction of acute cerebral ischemia. We used an iodinated vasopressin analogue and light microscopic autoradiography to study the distribution of vasopressin V1 receptors in the brain of adult male gerbils and to evaluate the effects of a transient bilateral cerebral ischemia (6 minutes) on the density of this receptor population. The animals were killed immediately or 10, 30, or 100 hours after transient bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries. In control animals, specific [125I]-VPA binding sites were present in various structures of the brain (olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nucleus, lateral septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, median preoptic area, ventral pallidum, substantia innominata, amygdala, thalamus, hypothalamic mammillary nuclei, superior colliculus, subiculum, central gray, nucleus of the solitary tract, hypoglossal nucleus). The strongest labeling was detected in the cerebral cortex, layers 5-6. After 30-100 hours of survival time following ischemia there was a marked decrease in [125I]-VPA binding site density in these cerebral cortex layers. To a lesser degree, a decrease was also detected in the lateral septal nucleus. In contrast, labeling in other noncortical structures remained unchanged. All animals with 100 hours recovery showed a loss of cells in hippocampus (CA1 layer) and striatum. In addition, ischemia induced concomitant and proliferative changes in cortical and hippocampal astrocytes assessed by glial fibrillary acid protein immunoreactivity. These observations indicate a role for vasopressin in the cerebral cortex either on neurons or on glial cells and the modulation of vasopressin receptor expression by transient cerebral ischemia.
