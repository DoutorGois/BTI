The relations of the basal preoptic area to mesencephalic RF, center median of the thalamus, hippocampus and posterior hypothalamus were studied in cats with the aid of positive wave (P-wave) evoked by preoptic stimulation during wakefulness and sleep. In light slow wave sleep, the amplitude and duration of P-wave increased for all the structures except hippocampus. Correlation between the P-wave amplitude in hippocampus and the duration of the paradoxical sleep was revealed. In paradoxical sleep, the P-wave of the mesencephalic RF and the center median was reduced as compared to wakefulness. Various functional properties of the P-wave evoked by preoptic stimulation, are discussed.
