Neurotoxicity of glutamate in conjunction with subcritical hypoxia was determined in vitro using hippocampal neurons obtained from 18-day-old rat fetuses. Neurons were plated at a low density and maintained for 3 days in a chemically defined medium without glutamate. When glutamate + was added after subcritical hypoxic stress, a low dose of glutamate, even at 10 microM, could cause significant neuronal loss in the following 24 h. The observed neurotoxicity to low glutamate dose (10-100 microM) could completely be prevented by 5 microM of 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX). This protective effect of CNQX was more potent than that of MK-801 ((+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate). The mechanism by which glutamate is transformed from a neurotransmitter to a neurotoxin is discussed.
