The distribution of the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS) was investigated at the ultrastructural level in synaptic structures of the hippocampal formation in relation to long-term potentiation (LTP), based on the histochemical NADPH-diaphorase (NADPH-d) staining with the tetrazolium salt BSPT. BSPT-formazan, the osmiophilic reaction product, was found to be selectively distributed and predominantly attached to membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum. In synaptic regions mainly the presynaptic sides showed labeling. Although several groups have demonstrated a principal involvement of NO in the LTP-mechanism, we found only a low, statistically insignificant increase in NADPH-d stained presynaptic areas of the dentate gyrus, where LTP was evoked. Postsynaptic elements also did not show any noticeable differences. Based on the present results, the predominantly presynaptic localization of NOS should be preferably considered in models describing a functional role of NO in LTP formation, despite the fact that we failed to reveal any indications for an LTP-related change in synaptically located NADPH-d.
