Gangliosides are sialic acid-containing sphingolipids that have promoting effects on the survival, growth, and functions of neurons in the central nervous system. Glial cells including astrocytes assist neurons with regard to their proliferation, maintenance, and function. In the present study, we found that astrocytes with ganglioside depletion caused by treatment with d-threo-1-phenyl-1-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (d-PDMP) exhibited reduced neuronal survival activity, as evaluated using low-density hippocampal cultures. The reduction was rescued by a ganglioside, GM3, suggesting that GM3 has significant effects on the glial cell activities that help neurons to proliferate and be maintained.
