Between 1993 and 2001, we observed fifteen patients (ten men and five women, mean age 63 years) with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) which preceded signs of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) which developed 21 months later. Mean disease duration in the fourteen deceased patients was 38 months. FTD associated with ALS is characterized by rapid course, predominance of disinhibited forms (orbito-basal), presence of aphasia with neologisms, and semantic memory disorders. Performed in all patients, single-photon emission computed tomography demonstrated a bifrontal pattern of low uptake, sometimes associated with low uptake in the anterior temporal region. In one patient, neuropathology revealed neuron atrophy and loss in the frontotemporal region, the anterior horns, and the hypoglossal nucleus. Ubiquitin-positive inclusions were visible in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and in the anterior horns. The dementia/ALS association is classically described is uncommon. It belongs to the FTD group since the Lund and Manchester consensus. Approximately 15 p.100 of patient with FTD can be expected to develop ALS. About 250 cases have been reported in the literature, half of them in the Pacific area where the incidence of ALS is high (55/100,000 inhabitants versus 1/100,000 in the rest of the world). Intermediary forms of FTD, semantic dementia, and progressive non-fluent aphasia are discussed since several cases of non-fluent progressive aphasia associated with ALS are reported in the literature. The links between these two degenerative diseases are discussed.
