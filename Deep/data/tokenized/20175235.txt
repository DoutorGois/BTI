OBJECTIVE: To examine the distribution of glucose transport 3 (GLUT 3) in different brain regions of aged rats and to investigate its role in ageing process of the nervous system. METHODS: The GLUT 3 expression in different brain regions was examined with immunohistochemical method in rats aged 3, 18 and 30 months, respectively. RESULTS: The number of GLUT 3-positive cells varied in the different brain regions in rats of all age groups (P<0.01); the CA1 region contained the greatest number of positive cells,and fewer in the motor cortex and cerebellum. The number of GLUT 3-positive cells was reduced in the brain of aged rats (P<0.01); and the neural cells in 4 different brain regions presented with large cell body and loose alignment. CONCLUSION: The expression of GLUT 3 decreased in aged rats, which suggests that GLUT 3 may be involved in the ageing process of nervous system.
