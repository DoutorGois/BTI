Heterozygous rolling Nagoya (rol/+) mice carrying Ca(V)2.1 alpha(1) mutation demonstrated normal behavior in Y maze test. Similar spontaneous alternation patterns were noted in wild-type and rol/+ mice injected with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA; 0-50mg/kg, sc). Systemic injection of NMDA receptor blocker (MK-801; 0.05 mg/kg, ip) or intrahippocampal injection of MK-801 (0.5 microg/side), which had no effect in wild-type controls, decreased spatial cognition in rol/+ mice. These results indicate that Ca(V)2.1 alpha(1) mutation probably through decrease in Ca(2+) influx lowers the threshold for learning impairment. The combination subthreshold pharmacological and genetic approach is useful to study functional pathways in neuronal circuits.
