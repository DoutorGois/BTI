Bombesin (BN)-like peptides regulate cell proliferation and cancer growth as well as neuroendocrine and neural functions. We evaluated the effects of the BN/gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) antagonist RC-3095 on memory formation. Male Wistar rats were given a bilateral infusion of saline or RC-3095 (0.2, 1.0 or 5.0 microg) into the dorsal hippocampus either immediately or 2 h after training in an inhibitory avoidance (IA) task. Retention test trials were carried out 1.5 h (short-term memory) and 24 h (long-term memory) after training. RC-3095 impaired both short- and long-term retention only when given immediately after training. The results suggest that the hippocampal BN/GRP receptor system modulates IA memory formation.
