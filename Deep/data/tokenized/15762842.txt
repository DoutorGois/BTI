For neuronal migration to occur, the cell must undergo morphological changes that require modifications of the cytoskeleton. Several different MAPs (microtubule-associated proteins) or actin-binding proteins are proposed to be involved in the migration of neurons. Therefore we have specifically analysed how two members of the MAP family, MAP1B and LIS1 (lissencephaly-related protein 1), interact with one another and participate in neuronal migration. Our results indicate that, in hippocampal neurons, MAP1B and LIS1 co-localize, associate and interact with each another. The interaction between these two MAPs is regulated by the phosphorylation of MAP1B. Furthermore, this interaction interferes with the association between LIS1 and the microtubule-dependent molecular motor, dynein. Clearly, the differential binding of these cytoskeletal proteins could regulate the functions attributed to the LIS1-dynein complex, including those related to extension of the neural processes necessary for neuronal migration.
