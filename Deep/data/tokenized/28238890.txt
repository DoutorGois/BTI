The transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) regulates neuronal differentiation, plasticity and survival. It is well established that excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate control NF-kappaB activity. Glutamate receptor overactivation is also involved in ischemic- and seizure-induced neuronal injury and neurodegeneration. However, little is known at the single cell-level how NF-kappaB signaling relates to neuronal survival during excitotoxic injury. We found that silencing of p65/NF-kappaB delayed N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-induced excitotoxic injury in hippocampal neurons, suggesting a functional role of p65 in excitotoxicity. Time-lapse imaging of p65 and its inhibitor IkappaBalpha using GFP and Cerulean fusion proteins revealed specific patterns of excitotoxic NF-kappaB activation. Nuclear translocation of p65 began on average 8+/-3min following 15min of NMDA treatment and was observed in up to two thirds of hippocampal neurons. Nuclear translocation of IkappaBalpha preceded that of p65 suggesting independent translocation processes. In surviving neurons, the onset of p65 nuclear export correlated with mitochondrial membrane potential recovery. Dying neurons exhibited persistent nuclear accumulation of p65-eGFP until plasma membrane permeabilization. Our data demonstrate an important role for p65 activation kinetics in neuronal cell death decisions following excitotoxic injury.
