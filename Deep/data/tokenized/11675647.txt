The present study was designed to investigate whether T(2)-weighted signal changes obtained by microimaging of paraformaldehyde-fixed brain correlate with the histologically quantified damage in a model of status epilepticus (SE) induced by kainic acid in the rat. Animals were killed at several time points up to 8 weeks after a single intraperitoneal kainate (KA) injection (9 mg/kg). Perfusion-fixed brains were embedded in gelatin for MR microimaging at 9.4T. After the MRI analysis, the gelatin was removed and the brains were cryoprotected and processed for quantitative histology. Severity of neuronal damage and gliosis were assessed from thionin-stained serial sections. Correlative analysis of microimaging and histology data was done in the hippocampus, amygdala, parietal rhinal cortex (PaRH), piriform cortex (Pir), and entorhinal cortex. The relative signal intensities in T(2)-weighted images correlate with the severity of neuronal damage in the matched histological sections (correlation coefficients of 0.752-0.826). Our data show that MR microimaging ex vivo detects the degree of neuronal damage and its anatomical distribution after KA-induced SE, thus providing a useful tool for detecting the dynamics of progressive neuronal damage after prolonged seizures.
