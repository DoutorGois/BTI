The dose-response and time-course effects of acute nicotine on total biopterin concentrations in the striatum, hypothalamus and hippocampus were examined in rats by using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection. Results indicated that across a wide dose range, only 0.5 mg/kg nicotine (free base) significantly increased biopterin level in the striatum and the hypothalamus, but not in the hippocampus. The time-course results revealed that the optimal time point for nicotine to exert this effect is around 30 min after systemic injection. These results suggest that nicotine may enhance catecholamine synthesis in these areas. It further implies that nicotine may alleviate the symptom of motor dysfunction as observed in certain neurological diseases.
