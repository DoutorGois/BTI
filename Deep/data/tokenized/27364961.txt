Pneumococcal meningitis is a life-threatening infection of the central nervous system (CNS) with a high mortality rate. In addition to causing severe neurological sequelae infectious diseases of the CNS can play a significant role in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders. In this study infant Wistar rats, postnatal day 11, received intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) either artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or a Streptococcus pneumoniae suspension to a concentration of 1 x 10(6) colony-forming units (CFU). 18 h later animals received antibiotic treatment as usual during 7 days. On postnatal day 46, the animals received imipramine intraperitoneal (i.p.) or sterile NaCl during 14 days (postnatal days 46-60). Then, on postnatal days 59-60 we evaluated the consumption of sweet food (an index of anhedonia). On postnatal day 60 the animals were submitted to the forced swimming task. 60 min after this task the animals were decapitated and the blood was collected to evaluate adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone. Immediately after blood collection the hippocampus was removed to evaluate brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). The meningitis group exhibited depressive-like behavior as evidenced by decreased sucrose intake and increased immobility time in the forced swimming task, and BDNF and GDNF decrease in the hippocampus. ACTH levels were increased in the blood. Imipramine treatment reversed depressive-like behaviors, re-established hippocampal BDNF and GDNF expression, and normalized ACTH levels in the blood. Here we demonstrate that meningitis during early life period can trigger depressive-like behavior in adult life of rats.
