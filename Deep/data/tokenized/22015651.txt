Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression represent important processes that modulate synaptic transmission that carries out a key role in neural mechanisms of memory. Many studies give strong evidences on a role of the reactive oxygen species in the induction of LTP in CA1 region of hippocampal slices that was inhibited by adding the scavenger enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Previous data showed that SOD1 is secreted by many cellular lines, including neuroblastoma SK-N-BE cells through microvesicles by an ATP-dependent mechanism; moreover, it has been shown that SOD1 interacts with human neuroblastoma cell membranes increasing intracellular calcium levels via a phospholipase C-protein kinase C pathway activation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of intracerebral injection of SOD1 or the inactive form of enzyme (ApoSOD) on the modulation of synaptic transmission in dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in urethane anesthetized rats. The results of the present research showed that intracerebral injection of SOD1 and ApoSOD in the dentate gyrus of the rat hippocampal formation inhibits LTP induced by high-frequency stimulation of the perforant path. This result cannot be only explained by the dismutation of oxygen radical induced by SOD1 since also ApoSOD, that lacks the enzymatic activity, carries out the same inhibitory effect on LTP induction.
