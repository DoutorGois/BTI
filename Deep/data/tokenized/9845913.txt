Glutamate receptor binding in the striatum of fast-learning (FL) and dull (D) rats was significantly higher than in the control. In slow-learning (SL) rats, this parameter was lesser than in the FL or D animals and even lesser than in the control. In all the groups of trained rats, the glutamate receptor binding level was increased as compared with the control, whereas in the brain cortex it was decreased. The glutamate-dopaminergic interaction seems to be important as a basis of learning ability.
