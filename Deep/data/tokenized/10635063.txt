Ionotropic GABA receptors that are composed of rho subunits act to gate bicuculline-insensitive Cl- currents. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the expression of rho 2 mRNA in adult rat brain was approximately eight times higher than mRNA in the rat brain at embryonic day 16, while that of rho 3 in the embryonic brain was approximately six times higher than in the adult brain. In the adult rat brain the rho 3 mRNA was present in the mesencephalon, hippocampus, cerebellum, thalamus and basal ganglia. In situ hybridization has been used to demonstrate the presence of rho 2 mRNA in the hippocampal CA1 region of the 8-day-old rat, and in the CAl region of the hippocampus, lateral geniculate nucleus, superficial gray layer of the superior colliculus and the pars compacta of the substantia nigra of the adult rat. When the homooligomeric rho 3 receptors were expressed in Xenopus oocytes, applications of agonists induced ionic currents. The order of potency of the agonists was muscimol > GABA = trans-4-amino-crotonic acid > cis-4-aminocrotonic acid. The ionic currents induced by GABA were blocked by picrotoxinin and Zn2+ in dose-dependent manner. In heterooligomeric rho 2 rho 3 receptors, picrotoxinin sensitivity was significantly reduced.
