By means of two-wave-length visible cytophotometry, the content of acidic and basic proteins per cell nucleus was shown to increase in CA3 hippocampal neurons only 3 hours after the learning session of conditioned reflex of passive avoidance. The protein content in the nuclei of perineuronal neuroglia cells of CA3 hippocampus increased only 6 hours after the learning session. Biochemical mechanisms dealing with the process of learning are discussed.
