Altering ganglioside concentration can modulate L-[3H]glutamic acid binding to synaptic membranes in vitro. This study indicates that a recently reported increase of hippocampal L-glutamate receptor density observed with entorhinal kindling is not associated with a quantitative change in hippocampal neuronal membrane sialoganglioside.
