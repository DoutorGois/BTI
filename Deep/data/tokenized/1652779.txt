To examine the effects of aging on the density and distribution of somatostatin receptors (SS-R) in the rat brain, receptor autoradiography for SS-R was carried out in rats aged 3 and 24 months using 125I-labeled Tyr11-SS-14. Autoradiograms were quantitatively assessed by an image analyzer to evaluate changes in the expression of SS-R due to senescence. Statistically significant decreases in SS-R binding were found in specific regions of the brains of senescent rats as compared to young adult rats. The regions affected included the periaqueductal gray matter (73% loss versus young adult rats), the interpeduncular nucleus (73% loss), the pontine nucleus (63% loss), the superior colliculus (46% loss), the ventral tegmental area (46% loss), the temporal cortex (39% loss), the frontal cortex (34% loss), the hippocampus (33% loss), the amygdala (27% loss) and the claustrum (26% loss). There was no significant change in SS-R expression in the spinal cord with aging. Significant reductions in SS-R binding in these brain regions may be involved in the impairment of sensory and cognitive function that can occur with aging.
