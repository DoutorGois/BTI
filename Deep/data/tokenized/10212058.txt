A minute dose of tetanus toxin injected into the amygdala of rats produced an apparently reversible epileptiform syndrome similar to that previously described after injection of the toxin into the hippocampus. During the active epilepsy the toxin-injected rats occasionally exhibited 'paroxysmal eating' and also sometimes ran round in circles attempting to bite their own tails. When presented with a novel but palatable food (chocolate buttons or harvest crunch) the toxin-injected rats showed less neophobia than their controls--they ate sooner and ate more. This was found both during the active epilepsy and several weeks later when they had recovered. A similar effect of amygdala injections was found in a second experiment, in which the effect was compared with that of toxin injection in the hippocampus. These rats were tested also on the playground maze on their approach response to a neutral novel object (in a familiar environment in the context of seven familiar objects). The amygdala rats did not show any increase in their novelty response; thus their reduction in neophobia was specific to an appetitive behaviour. In contrast, the hippocampally-injected rats did not exhibit a novelty response in the playground maze, but showed normal neophobia to a new food.
