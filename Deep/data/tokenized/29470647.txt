The catecholamine dopamine plays an important role in hippocampus-dependent plasticity and related learning and memory processes. Dopamine secretion in the hippocampus is activated by, e.g., salient or novel stimuli, thereby helping to establish and to stabilize hippocampus-dependent memories. Disturbed dopaminergic function in the hippocampus leads to severe pathophysiological conditions. While the role and importance of dopaminergic modulation of hippocampal networks have been unequivocally proven, there is still a lack of detailed molecular and cellular mechanistic understanding of how dopamine orchestrates these hippocampal processes. In this chapter of the special issue "Hippocampal structure and function," we will discuss the current understanding of dopaminergic modulation of basal synaptic transmission and long-lasting, activity-dependent potentiation or depression.
