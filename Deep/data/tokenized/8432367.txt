The spontaneously epileptic rat (SER:zi/zi, tm/tm), a double mutant, shows both tonic convulsions and absence-like seizures characterized by low-voltage fast waves and by 5-7 Hz spike and wave-like complexes in the cerebral cortical and hippocampal EEG, respectively. Characteristics of hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons were examined to determine whether these neurons are abnormally excitable. When a single stimulus was given to the mossy fiber, there was repetitive firing and a depolarization shift in neurons of mature SER (over 12 weeks old), in which epileptic seizures had fully developed. However, in young SER (7-8 weeks old) and littermates (zi/zi, tm/+), which did not show any seizures, only a single spike was elicited with each single stimulation of the mossy fiber. Intracellular recording showed that the resting membrane potential was not significantly different among young and mature SER and littermates, but a long-lasting (100-200 ms) depolarizing shift accompanied by repetitive firing was observed following a single stimulation of the mossy fiber in half of the CA3 neurons of mature SER. Furthermore, the input impedance of the CA3 neurons in mature SER was lower than that in young SER and in littermates. These results indicate that SER hippocampal CA3 neurons become abnormally excitable in conjunction with the development of epileptic seizures.
