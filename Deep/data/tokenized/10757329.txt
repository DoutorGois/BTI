We investigated expression of hsp70 and c-jun mRNA with in situ hybridization for evaluating hypothermia effect on the brain exposed to subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). SAH was induced in Wistar rats with endovascular perforation. Animals were divided arbitrarily into normothermic and hypothermic groups, and they were sacrificed at 3 h or 12 h after SAH. The SAH induced hsp70 and c-jun mRNAs in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, and caudoputamen. Mild hypothermia depressed hsp70 mRNA expression in the cortex, thalamus, and hippocampus. The c-jun mRNA expression was reduced by hypothermia in the cortex, thalamus, and CA1 of the hippocampus. Based on these findings, we speculate that hypothermia protects the brain exposed to SAH by reducing this stress response. Although it is yet difficult to employ hypothermia in the clinical settings, this study suggests its utility to those patients sustaining severe subarachnoid hemorrhage.
