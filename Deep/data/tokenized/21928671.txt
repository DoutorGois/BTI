OBJECTIVE: To study the analgesia mechanism of needle-knife lysis in spinal cord and other parts of central nervous system by comparing the changes of Leu-Enkephalin (L-ENK) content in different parts of centrium of rats undergone needle-knife lysis and electro-acupuncture respectively. METHODS: Sixty healthy SD rats were randomly devided into normal control group, model group, needle-knife lysis (NKL) group and electro-acupuncture (EA) group. 4% papain solution mixed with 0.3 mol/L cysteine solutin in the ratio of 1:1, paused for 0.5 h,injected the mixture, 20 microl each time,into the left knee joint cavities of rats in model, NKL, EA groups at the 1st, 4th, 7th day. After 4 weeks in NKL group and EA group were treated with needle-knife lysis and electro-acupuncture, respectively. Three weeks after treatment, samples of spinal cord of the swollen part of rat waists and rat brains were taken from and the content of L-ENK of medulla oblongata, midbrain, pituitary gland, and hippocampus were measured. RESULTS: L-ENK content of model group increased higher than that of normal control group in spinal cord, hippocampus and midbrain (P < 0.01); there were no significant difference between normal control group and modle group on L-ENK in medulla oblongata and thalamus (P > 0.05). After intervening of NKL or EA, L-ENK content of NKL group increased higher in hippocampus than that of model group and EC group (P < 0.05); but L-ENK content of NKL group in midbrain was lower than that of model group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Needle-knife lysis has characteristic of regulation for the L-ENK content in different parts of central nervous system of rats with knee osteoarthritis, and analgesic effect of needle-knife was possibly related with regulation of center L-ENK.
