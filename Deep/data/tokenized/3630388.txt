Noradrenaline content is lower in the diencephalon of rats with genetic predisposition to catalepsy as compared to control Wistar population. Besides, there is a statistically non significant tendency to a lower noradrenaline level in the striatum and hippocampus. Pain stimulus induces in cataleptic rats a smaller decrease in noradrenaline than in Wistar. The shock-induced aggression is higher in cataleptic rats than in Wistar. All these data point to a lower noradrenergic activity in rats with genetic predisposition to catalepsy. In cataleptic rats, both the development and extinction of the conditioned avoidance reaction is slower than in Wistar. The changes of noradrenergic activity and learning are similar to those described in chronic amphetamine intoxication. It is supposed that these changes in learning are caused by increased serotonergic (found earlier) and decreased noradrenergic activity.
