Low-molecular mimetics of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) loops 1 and 4 representing to monomeric and dimeric amides of N-acyldipeptides were constructed and synthesized. The sequence of these dipeptides coinside with the central regions of beta-turns of corresponding loops of neurotrophine sequence, and acyl groups are bioisosters of preceding amino acid residues. Hexa- and heptamethylenediamine were used as spacers linking C-terminus ofdipeptides in BDNF dimeric mimetics. These substances were synthesized by classic peptide synthesis methods in solution and got laboratory codes GSB-104 (HO-Suc-Ser-Lys-NH2), GSB-106 ([HO-Suc-Ser-Lys-NH-(CH2)3-]2), GSB-207 (HO-Suc-Met-Ser-NH2) and GSB-214 ([HO-Suc-Met-Ser-NH-(CH2)7/2-]2). By using the culture of immortalized hippocampal cell line HT-22 on the oxidative stress conditions it was shown that dimeric mimetics of both loops demonstrated neuroprotective activity in the concentration rage of 10(-5)-10(-8) M. Monomeric loop 1 mimetic GSB-207 was inactive in the same concentrations and monomeric loop 4 mimetic GSB-104 in a concentration of 10(-7) M decreased survival of neurons. Presence of neuroprotective activity only for dimeric mimetics correlates with the data that BDNF is active only in homodimeric form. As opposed to dimeric mimetic of loop 1 GSB-214, dimeric mimetic of loop 4 GSB-106 demonstrates specific for BDNF antidepressive activity in Porsolt test on rats in doses 0.1 and 1 mg/kg i.p. It is suggested that antidepressive activity of BDNF is associated with its loop 4. We consider that compounds obtained will be useful for investigation of BDNF action mechanism and can lead to creation of a new group of medicinal substances with antidepressive and neuroprotective activities.
