In view of recent evidence for a role for the B subtype of cholecystokinin (CCKB) receptor in panic and anxiety, the distribution of CCKB receptors in the forebrain of a Rhesus macaca monkey was examined by receptor autoradiography employing [125I]D-Tyr25(Nleu28,31)-CCK25-33S. CCKB receptors were widely and topographically distributed in cortex. Other structures with notable labelling included the basal ganglia, presubiculum, amygdala, mamillary bodies, cerebellar cortex and pineal gland. The distribution of CCKB receptors further supports roles for this peptide in behavioural processes.
