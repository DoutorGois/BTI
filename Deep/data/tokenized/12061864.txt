Bis (also called Bag-3), identified as a novel Bcl-2-interacting protein, has been shown to enhance anti-cell death activity of Bcl-2. Because ischemia/reperfusion induces expression of Bcl-2, we examined the changes in the pattern of Bis expression in the adult rat hippocampus after transient forebrain ischemia. Western blot analysis with protein extracts from the hippocampus showed that, compared with controls, levels of Bis were markedly increased seven days after ischemia. An immunohistochemical study showed that the expression of Bis increased preferentially in the CA1 and the dentate hilar regions, and peaked at 3-7 days after reperfusion. The temporal and spatial patterns of expression for both Bis and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were very similar, and double immunofluorescence histochemistry showed that Bis was expressed in reactive astrocytes, which express GFAP. Immunolabeling of adjacent sections with anti-Bcl-2 and anti-Hsp70 antibodies revealed that the pattern of Bis expression closely correlates with that of Bcl-2, but clearly differs from that of Hsp70. Coexpression of Bis and Bcl-2 in reactive astrocytes was confirmed by double immunofluorescence histochemistry. Our results demonstrate that reactive astrocytes transiently up-regulate Bis after ischemia/reperfusion in the adult rat hippocampus. However, the precise role of Bis in the astrocytic response to ischemia/reperfusion in relation to Bcl-2 remains to be determined.
