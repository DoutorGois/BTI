Changes in nicotinic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors 30 min after one-trial passive avoidance training were studied in day-old chicks (Gallus domesticus), by quantitative receptor autoradiography. [3H]-alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-BgT) and [3H]-quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) were used to monitor changes in 15 forebrain regions for nicotinic and muscarinic receptors, respectively. A significant increase occurred bilaterally in the quantity of bound alpha-BgT in the lobus parolfactorius, while the amount of bound QNB decreased significantly, and bilaterally, in the hippocampus, hyperstriatum ventrale, lobus parolfactorius and posterolateral telencephalon, pars dorsalis. The data support an involvement of cholinergic receptor types in the neural mechanisms underlying passive avoidance learning.
