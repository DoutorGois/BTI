Synaptic dysfunction underlies cognitive deficits induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH). There are silent synapses in neural circuits, but the effect of CCH on silent synapses is unknown. The present study was designed to explore learning and memory deficits and dynamic changes in silent synapses by direct visualization in a rat model of CCH. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to permanent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) to reproduce CCH. Learning and memory effects were examined at 1, 4, 12, and 24 weeks after BCCAO. In addition, immunofluorescent confocal microscopy was used to detect AMPA and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors colocalized with synaptophysin, and Golgi-Cox staining was used to observe dendritic spine density. We found that BCCAO rats exhibited recognition memory deficits from 4 weeks; spatial learning and memory, as well as working memory impairment began at 1 week and persistent to 24 weeks after surgery. Following BCCAO, the percentage of silent synapses increased by 29.81-55.08% compared with the controls at different time points (P<0.001). Compared with control groups, dendritic spine density in the CA1 region of BCCAO groups significantly decreased (P<0.001). Thus, the present study suggests that CCH can induce long-lasting cognitive deficits and long-term increase in the number of silent synapses. Furthermore, the decrease in dendritic spine density was correlated with the decrease in the number of functional synapses. The results suggest a potential mechanism by which CCH can induce learning and memory deficits.
