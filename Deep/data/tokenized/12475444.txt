OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of selenium (Se) and iodine (I) and the compound of both on the proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-jun mRNA and their protein expression in the cultured rat hippocampus neurons. METHODS: Using the technique of serum free hippocampus neuron culture, different doses of Se and I and Se + I compound were added into the medium. The expression of the mRNA of c-fos, c-jun in hippocampus neurons cultured for 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 d were studied using both in situ hybridization and SABC immunohistochemical technique. RESULTS: Both Se and I could enhance the expression of c-fos, c-jun mRNA and their proteins, especially the combination of I and Se able to give a remarkable effect on c-jun mRNA expression. CONCLUSIONS: Se and I may effect the expression of both c-fos and c-jun mRNA, especially the c-jun mRNA and its protein of hippocampus neurons, and thus may effect the differentiation and development of neurons.
