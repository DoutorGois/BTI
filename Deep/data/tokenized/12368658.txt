The authors studied the differences between heat-shock/stress protein 70 (hsp70) gene expression and protein synthesis in the unilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) microsurgical direct occlusion (Tamura's) model and the unilateral intraluminal occlusion model. In Tamura's model, expression of hsp70 mRNA and HSP70 protein and decreased protein synthesis were detected in the ischemic areas, including the ipsilateral cortex and caudate. These phenomena, however, were not observed in the areas outside the MCA territory, including the ipsilateral thalamus, hippocampus, and substantia nigra. These results were consistent among the experimental rats. In the intraluminal occlusion model, however, induction of both hsp70 mRNA and HSP70 protein and impairment of protein synthesis were noted in the areas outside the MCA territory, including the ipsilateral thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and substantia nigra, as well as in the MCA territory, including the ipsilateral cortex and caudate. These results were not consistent among the experimental rats. These different results might be due to widespread damage resulting from internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion in the intraluminal occlusion model. Accordingly, the authors suggest that this model be called an ICA occlusion model, rather than a pure MCA occlusion model.
