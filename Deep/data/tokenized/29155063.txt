BACKGROUND: Patients with bitemporal lobe epilepsy are generally not considered for surgical resection. Fortunately, responsive neurostimulation provides another avenue for the management of this challenging disease process. In conjunction with our epileptologist, we consider responsive neurostimulation for patients who have clinical features of temporal lobe epilepsy without clear localization on imaging and stereoelectroencephalography. METHODS: Here we describe our technique for implanting a responsive neurostimulator (NeuroPace, NeuroPace Inc., Mountain View, California) with depth electrodes monitoring the hippocampus and parahippocampus using stereotactic robotic guidance (ROSA, Medtech SA, Montpeillier, France). RESULTS: We have used this technique with 5 patients without morbidity. Four of 5 patients have received clinical benefit (Engel classification I-III). Promisingly, long-term seizure monitoring with use of the NeuroPace system has suggested lateralizing information on 3 of these patients that was not apparent on previous invasive monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: Robotically implanted responsive neurostimulation is a safe and effective treatment for bitemporal epilepsy and can possibly lead to valuable diagnostic information to guide future surgical management in patients who previously were not considered candidates for resective or ablative surgery.
