Damage to the hippocampal region has shown varying effects on feed and water intake in rats. Three experiments were conducted to determine whether hippocampal ablation influences feed and water intake in the chick. Thirteen to 20 chicks in each trial were assigned randomly to lesioned or sham-operated control groups. Feed and water intake was monitored for 24 or 48 h following recovery from the surgical procedure. No differences were noted in either parameter measured. The current studies indicate that hippocampal ablation has no effect on ingestive behavior in the chick.
