Male Sprague-Dawley rats were rendered tolerant to and physically dependent on U-50,488H, a kappa-opiate agonist, by injecting 25 mg/kg of the drug intraperitoneally twice a day for 4 days. Two sets of rats were used. Rats labeled as tolerant-dependent were injected with U-50,488H (25 mg/kg) 1 h before sacrificing on day 5, whereas the abstinent rats were sacrificed on day 5 without the injection of U-50,488H. Of all the tissues on day 5 without the injection of U-50,488H. Of all the tissues examined, the pituitary gland had the highest level of dynorphin (1-13), whereas the heart had the lowest level. The levels of dynorphin (1-13) increased in the hypothalamus, hippocampus and pons/medulla of U-50,488H tolerant-dependent rats, whereas in abstinent rats the levels of dynorphin (1-13) were elevated only in the midbrain. The levels of dynorphin (1-13) in the pituitary gland of U-50,488H tolerant-dependent or abstinent rats were unchanged. In peripheral tissues, the levels of dynorphin (1-13) in the heart of U-50,488H tolerant-dependent rats were increased. In the abstinent rats they were elevated in the adrenals, spleen, and the heart but were decreased in the kidneys. Compared to morphine tolerant-dependent and abstinent rats, significant differences in the levels of dynorphin (1-13) in tissues of 50,488H tolerant-dependent and abstinent rats were observed and may explain many pharmacological differences in the mu- and kappa-opiate induced tolerance-dependence and abstinence processes.
