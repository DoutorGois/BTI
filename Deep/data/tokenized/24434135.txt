Upon synaptic vesicle fusion, the neuronal membrane surface expands. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis compensates for this expansion but is a slow process. Recent studies in eLife and Nature identify an ultrafast mode of endocytosis, occurring in the space between active and periactive zones, that compensates for membrane addition during vesicle fusion.
