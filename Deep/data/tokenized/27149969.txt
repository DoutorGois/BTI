The development of agents that affect two or more relevant targets has drawn considerable attention in treatment of AD. Diallyl disulfide (DADS), an active principle of garlic, has been reported to prevent APP processing by amyloidogenic pathway. Recently, we have reported a new series of DADS derivatives and our findings revealed that compound 7k and 7l could provide good templates for developing new multifunctional agents for AD treatment. Thus, the present study was constructed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of DADS analogues (7k and 7l) against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells and in ameliorating the cognition deficit induced by scopolamine in rat model. The results indicated that compound 7k and 7l significantly inhibited Abeta1-42-induced neuronal cell death by inhibiting ROS generation. Moreover, they prevented apoptosis, in response to ROS, by restoring normal Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Furthermore, it was observed that scopolamine-induced memory impairment was coupled by alterations in neurotransmitters, acetylcholinesterase activity and oxidative stress markers. Histological analysis revealed severe damaging effects of scopolamine on the structure of cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Administration of compounds 7k and 7l at 5 mg/kg significantly reversed scopolamine-induced behavioural, biochemical, neurochemical and histological changes in a manner comparable to standard donepezil. Together the present findings and previous studies indicate that compounds 7k and 7l have neuroprotective and cognition-enhancing effects, which makes them a promising multi-target candidate for addressing the complex nature of AD.
