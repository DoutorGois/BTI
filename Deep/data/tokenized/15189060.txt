Epileptic seizures are considered to result from a sudden change in the synchronization of firing neurons in brain neural networks. We have used an in vitro model of status epilepticus (SE) to characterize dynamical regimes underlying the observed seizure-like activity. Time intervals between spikes or bursts were used as the variable to construct first-return interpeak or interburst interval plots, for studying neuronal population activity during the transition to seizure, as well as within seizures. Return maps constructed for a brief epoch before seizures were used for approximating the local system dynamics during that time window. Analysis of the first-return maps suggests that intermittency is a dynamical regime underlying the observed epileptic activity. This type of analysis may be useful for understanding the collective dynamics of neuronal populations in the normal and pathological brain.
