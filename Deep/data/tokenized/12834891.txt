In a whole-cell patch-clamp configuration, currents through N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor channels were monitored in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, and those currents were depressed to 25 and 28% of basal levels, respectively, by 3-min treatment with tunicamycin (10 microM), an inhibitor of protein N-glycosylation. Tunicamycin (10 microM) reduced amplitude of population spikes elicited in the dentate gyrus of rat hippocampal slices, reaching 78% of basal levels 60 min after the beginning of treatment, and long-term potentiation (LTP) of the perforant path was never induced in the presence of tunicamycin. Tunicamycin, thus, appears to serve as a modulator for NMDA and AMPA receptors, regardless of N-glycosylation, thereby inhibiting neurotransmission and LTP in the dentate gyrus.
