Pregnant rats were exposed to ethanol (EtOH) and/or methyl mercury (MeHg) during fetal brain development. Nitrergic activity was quantified by densitometric measurement of formazan deposits in the hippocampus, cerebellum and striatum of two-month-old offspring following histochemical assay for NADPH-diaphorase (NADPH-d) activity. Compared to control subjects, an increase in nitrergic activity was found in the molecular layer of dentate gyrus and in the lacunosum molecular and stratum radiatum of CA1 (cornus amoni 1) in the EtOH+MeHg group, whereas a single administration of EtOH increased the activity in all striatal segments. The cerebellum seems to be less sensitive at this time-point to intoxication, and presented an increase only at the molecular layer of EtOH-exposed animals when compared to the MeHg and EtOH+MeHg groups (ANOVA, one-way followed by Tukey's test, p<0.05 or p<0.01). Taken together, results suggest that developmental exposure to EtOH and MeHg, singularly or in combination, alters nitrergic activity in adult rat in different ways depending on the region and layer of the central nervous system (CNS), and that these alterations might be related to different local metabolic properties.
