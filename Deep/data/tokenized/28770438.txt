In the present study, we investigated the concentration-dependent effect of zinc (Zn) supplementation on the adult hippocampus in a high-fat diet (HFD)-fed obese mouse model. Four-weeks after HFD- and control diet (CD)-feeding, mice were provided with low (15 ppm) or high (60 ppm) doses of Zn in their drinking water for additional 4 more weeks along with their respective diets. Compared to the CD-fed mice, HFD-feeding elicited the reduction of neurogenic markers such as nestin, Ki67, doublecortin (DCX), and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) in the dentate gyrus. Additionally, HFD-feeding reduced the levels of synaptic markers (synaptophysin and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), while lipid peroxidation was significantly increased in the hippocampus of HFD-fed mice. Against detrimental effects of high-dose Zn, low-dose Zn supplementation in CD-fed mice did not yield any remarkable changes in these parameters. Interestingly, administration of low doses of Zn to HFD-induced obese mice prominently ameliorated HFD-induced changes in neurogenic, synaptic plasticity markers and BDNF levels as well as lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus. In contrast, high-dose Zn supplementation in HFD-fed mice exacerbated the reduction of markers for neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity as well as BDNF levels, but not 4-HNE levels, in the hippocampus. These results suggest that low-dose Zn supplementation in obese mice could reverse the HFD-induced reduction in neurogenic and synaptic marker proteins in the hippocampus by reducing lipid peroxidation and improving BDNF expression, while high-dose Zn supplementation exacerbates the reduction of neurogenesis by affecting synaptic markers and BDNF levels in the hippocampus.
