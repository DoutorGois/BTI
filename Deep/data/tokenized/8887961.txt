This study investigated the in vitro and in vivo excitotoxic properties of a novel conformationally constrained analogue of L-glutamate, L-trans-2,3-pyrrolidine dicarboxylate (L-trans-2,3-PDC). When tested for excitotoxic activity in rat cortical cultures, L-trans-2,3-PDC mimicked the action of NMDA in both acute (30 min) and chronic (24 h) exposure paradigms. This neurotoxicity was attenuated by co-addition of MK-801 (10 microM). Microinjections of L-trans-2,3-PDC into the dorsal hippocampus of male rats also induced a selective pattern of pathology indicative of an NMDA receptor excitotoxin. In contrast to the equipotency observed in vitro, 100 nmol of L-trans-2,3-PDC were needed to produce cellular damage comparable to that induced by 25 nmol of NMDA. Consistent with an action at NMDA receptors, L-trans-2,3-PDC-induced damage could be significantly reduced by co-administration of MK-801 (3 mg/kg i.p.), but not by NBQX (25 nmol). In radioligand binding assays L-trans-2,3-PDC inhibited the binding of 3H-L-glutamate to NMDA receptors (IC50 1 microM), although it also exhibited some cross reactivity with KA and AMPA receptors. L-trans-2,3-PDC was also identified as a competitive inhibitor (Ki = 33 microM) of 3H-D-aspartate uptake into rat forebrain synaptosomes. In contrast to the action of a transported substrate, such as L-glutamate, L-trans-2,3-PDC did not exchange with 3H-D-aspartate that had been previously loaded into the synaptosomes.
