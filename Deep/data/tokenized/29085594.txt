OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of mild hypothermia on expression of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1) of rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus after cardiopulmonary resuscitation and further investigate the possible mechanism of action. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To copy an asphyxia heart arrest model, Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into normothermia group, mild hypothermia group before restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and mild hypothermia group after ROSC. Body temperature in normothermia group was maintained at 37.5-39 degrees C, while in mild hypothermia group maintained at 32-34 degrees C by surface cooling with the ice pack. Each group then divided into three subgroups: 15 min, 30 min, and 60 min. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 mRNA in cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining was performed to observe histological changes. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 protein expression. RESULTS: The expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 in cerebral cortex and hippocampus after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was significantly increased and mild hypothermia up regulated this level. HE staining showed that mild hypothermia significantly improved neuronal injury. CONCLUSION: Mild hypothermia has neuroprotective effects on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury after cardiac arrest. The possible mechanism is that Nrf2-ARE pathway in cerebral cortex and hippocampus after CPR is activated.
