Epidemiological studies have indicated hypercholesterolemia in midlife as a risk factor for dementia in later life, bringing cholesterol to the forefront of Alzheimer's disease research. Herein, we modeled mild hypercholesterolemia in mice to evaluate biochemical and behavioral alterations linked to hypercholesterolemia. Swiss mice were fed a high fat/cholesterol diet (20 % fat and 1.25 % cholesterol) for an 8-week period (from 12 to 18 weeks old) and were tested on the object location, forced swimming and elevated plus-maze tasks. We also investigated hypercholesterolemia-induced changes on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, oxidative damage, amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity within the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. It was found that increased AChE activity within the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus is an early event associated with hypercholesterolemia-induced short-term memory impairments. We observed no signs of antioxidant imbalance and/or oxidative damage or changes in cortical and hippocampal densities of beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 and aquaporin-4, biomarkers of APP processing and BBB integrity, respectively. In addition, we treated SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in an attempt to manipulate cell cholesterol content. Notably, LDL cholesterol increased in a dose-dependent manner the activity of AChE in SH-SY5Y cells. The present findings provide new evidence that increased AChE activity within the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus is an early event associated with hypercholesterolemia-induced cognitive impairments.
