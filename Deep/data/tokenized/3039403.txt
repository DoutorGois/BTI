We have shown experimentally in the previous paper that spontaneous epileptiform activity, as recorded by extracellular field potentials, propagates smoothly across the CA2-CA3 region of the convulsant-treated hippocampal slice of the guinea pig at velocities of about 0.1 m/s. In the present paper, we used computer simulations of either 500 or 1000 cell arrays of model neurons to examine possible mechanisms underlying this propagation. We show that propagation of epileptiform field potentials can be explained plausibly by slow conduction along axons interconnecting CA2-CA3 neurons, provided that there are sufficiently many interconnections. This propagation can take place even if the interconnections occur randomly. The number of interconnections required decreases as the number of synchronously activated cells initiating a population burst increases. Axonal propagation at 0.1 m/s appears to be a plausible assumption, since conduction velocities along Schaffer collaterals have been experimentally estimated to be as slow as 0.2 m/s, and small recurrent collaterals are likely to conduct more slowly than the main axonal branches. If spontaneous synchronized population bursts are initiated by activity in four or fewer cells, then our model requires, for smooth field potential propagation, more interconnections than are believed to occur on the basis of dual intracellular recording.
