We studied the effect of endocannabinoid N-arachidonoyl dopamine on spontaneous bioelectric activity of cultured hippocampal neurons in a model of hypoxia/reoxygenation. Incubation under hypoxic conditions induced irreversible decrease in spontaneous bioelectric activity of neurons and their death. Application of N-arachidonoyl dopamine during hypoxia and in the post-hypoxic period preserved bioelectric activity and viability of neurons. The protective effect of N-arachidonoyl dopamine was primarily mediated by type I cannabinoid receptors.
