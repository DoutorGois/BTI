Intravenous procaine HCl given at low doses (0.5-2.5 mg/kg) to two monkeys with bilateral alumina hippocampal foci depressed interictal spiking or had little effect. At 5.0 mg/kg unilateral limbic activation occurred. At 10.0 mg/kg unilateral or bilateral limbic activation and generalized seizures could be evoked within 3-10 min. At higher doses (15 and 20 mg/kg) bilateral limbic activation or brief (one min) generalized seizures occurred. The unilateral-onset psychomotor seizures were not identical to spontaneous psychomotor seizures, and the generalized seizures never occurred spontaneously in these monkeys. However, these results do indicate that procaine challenges may selectively activate limbic epileptogenic areas without activation of debilitating generalized tonic-clonic seizures.
