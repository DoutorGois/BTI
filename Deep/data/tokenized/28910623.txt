Egocentric neural coding has been observed in parietal cortex (PC), but its topographical and laminar organization is not well characterized. We used multi-site recording to look for evidence of local clustering and laminar consistency of linear and angular velocity encoding in multi-neuronal spiking activity (MUA) and in the high-frequency (300-900 Hz) component of the local field potential (HF-LFP), believed to reflect local spiking activity. Rats were trained to run many trials on a large circular platform, either to LED-cued goal locations or as a spatial sequence from memory. Tuning to specific self-motion states was observed and exhibited distinct cortical depth-invariant coding properties. These patterns of collective local and laminar activation during behavior were reactivated in compressed form during post-experience sleep and temporally coupled to cortical delta waves and hippocampal sharp-wave ripples. Thus, PC neuron motion encoding is consistent across cortical laminae, and this consistency is maintained during memory reactivation.
