The method of immunization with hippocampal tissue cytosol was employed for functional disturbance of hippocampus in newborn and mature rats. This influence resulted in behavioral disorders resembling the hippocampectomy consequences. There were ++non-decremental motor activity and rearing in "open field" test and an improvement in acquisition of active avoidance response in adult rats (250-300 g). In young animals the decreased levels of motor and exploratory activity in "open field" and difficulties in active avoidance learning (in 40 days) were the main features of hippocampal disturbance. In case of immunization with neocortical cytosol no significant alterations in behavior were revealed.
