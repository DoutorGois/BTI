Ghrelin, an endogenous ligand for the GH secretagogue receptor (GHS-R) receptor 1a (GHS-R1a), has been implicated in several physiologic processes involving the hippocampus. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms of ghrelin-stimulated neurogenesis using cultured adult rat hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs). The expression of GHS-R1a was detected in hippocampal NSCs, as assessed by western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry. Ghrelin treatment increased the proliferation of cultured hippocampal NSCs assessed by BrdU incorporation. The exposure of cells to the receptor-specific antagonist d-Lys-3-GHRP-6 abolished the proliferative effect of ghrelin. By contrast, ghrelin showed no significant effect on cell differentiation. The expression of GHS-R1a was significantly increased by ghrelin treatment. The analysis of signaling pathways showed that ghrelin caused rapid activation of ERK1/2 and Akt, which were blocked by the GHS-R1a antagonist. In addition, ghrelin stimulated the phosphorylation of Akt downstream effectors, such as glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and p70(S6K). The activation of STAT3 was also caused by ghrelin treatment. Furthermore, pretreatment of cells with specific inhibitors of MEK/ERK1/2, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, mTOR, and Jak2/STAT3 attenuated ghrelin-induced cell proliferation. Taken together, our results support a role for ghrelin in adult hippocampal neurogenesis and suggest the involvement of the ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt, and STAT3 signaling pathways in the mediation of the actions of ghrelin on neurogenesis. Our data also suggest that PI3K/Akt-mediated inactivation of GSK-3beta and activation of mTOR/p70(S6K) contribute to the proliferative effect of ghrelin.
