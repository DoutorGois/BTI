The possible role of endogenous cholinergic innervation in hippocampal plasticity is controversial. We studied the role of acetylcholine (ACh) in short- and long-term potentiation (STP and LTP), using the cholinergic neurotoxin 192 IgG-saporin. It was still possible to induce STP the LTP in the CA1 field following complete and selective cholinergic denervation of the hippocampus. This study therefore demonstrates that integrity of the endogenous cholinergic system is not necessary for the induction or maintenance of LTP in the CA1 field of the hippocampus. The consequences in terms of relationship between hippocampal cholinergic system, LTP and memory are discussed.
