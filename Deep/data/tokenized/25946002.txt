The spatiotemporally controlled expression of G-CaMP fluorescent calcium indicator proteins can facilitate reliable imaging of brain circuit activity. Here, we generated a transgenic mouse line that expresses G-CaMP7 under a tetracycline response element. When crossed with a forebrain-specific tetracycline-controlled transactivator driver line, the mice expressed G-CaMP7 in defined cell populations in a tetracycline-controlled manner, notably in pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 of the cortex and in the CA1 area of the hippocampus; this expression allowed for imaging of the in vivo activity of these circuits. This mouse line thus provides a useful genetic tool for controlled G-CaMP expression in vivo.
