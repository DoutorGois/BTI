Objectives are to examine the effects of sleep deprivation (SD) on spatial learning and memory in mice, to determine how SD effects the expression of phosphorylated cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein (pCREB) in mouse hippocampus, and to explore the mechanism of influence of sleep deprivation on cognitive function. Twenty, 3-month-old female C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned into two groups, the sleep deprivation group (SD, n = 10) and control group with normal sleep (CC, n = 10). The mice in SD group were deprived sleep by "gentle touch" for 20 days and then all the mice were subjected for Morris Water Maze test to determine the mean latency of escape (LE). Percentage of time spent in the target quadrant was calculated. Mouse hippocampus pCREB levels were quantified by western blot. Compared with CC group, SD mice had a significantly longer mean LE time (P < 0.05) and spent less time in the target quadrant (P < 0.05). Western blot revealed that hippocampus pCREB levels in the SD group were significantly lower than that in control group (0.71 +/- 0.03 vs 0.82 +/- 0.06, P < 0.01). The impairment in spatial learning and memory in sleep-deprived animals may be associated with the reduction of pCREB in the hippocampus.
