Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain trace-element imbalances in the amygdala, hippocampus and nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM) are found in most cases to be consistent with those previously reported in samples derived principally from AD cerebral cortex (Ehmann et al., 1986). The elevation of mercury in AD nbM, as compared to age-matched controls, is the largest trace-element imbalance observed to date in AD brain. In addition to the general confirmation of imbalances for Cs, Hg, N, Na, P, and Rb noted previously in cerebral cortex samples, imbalances for Fe, K, Sc, and Zn were observed in two regions and one region also exhibited imbalances for both Co and Se. Persistent imbalances for the univalent cations Na, K, Rb and Cs support arguments for a membrane abnormality in AD. The data presented here also provide the first comprehensive simultaneous multi-element determinations in both control and AD nbM.
