Dysregulation of the serotonergic system and abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis have been demonstrated in major depression. Animal studies indicate that 5-HT1A receptor expression may be reduced by long-term administration of corticosterone. However, similar studies on the regulation of GIRK channels, one of the most important effectors of the neuronal 5-HT1A receptor, are limited. In order to address these issues, slow-release corticosterone pellets were implanted subcutaneously to adrenal intact male rats (200mg pellets, 35 days release). Starting on day 15, animals were treated for 21 days with fluoxetine (5mg/kg/day, i.p.), or vehicle. Using in situ hybridization histochemistry and receptor autoradiography, we found that chronic corticosterone treatment was accompanied by a significant decrease on the mRNAs coding for mineralocorticoid receptors in hippocampal areas. Under these conditions, 5-HT1A receptor mRNA expression decreased in dorsal raphe nucleus and dentate gyrus. However, 5-HT1A receptor levels, as measured by [(3)H]-8-OH-DPAT binding, diminished significantly only in dentate gyrus. It is noteworthy that chronic treatment with fluoxetine reversed the alterations on 5-HT1A receptor mRNA levels only in dorsal raphe. Finally, chronic corticosterone treatment produced an increase on the mRNA coding for the GIRK2 subunit in several hypothalamic and thalamic areas, which was reversed by fluoxetine. Measurements of cell density and volume of the granular layer of the dentate gyrus did not reveal significant changes after corticosterone or corticosterone plus fluoxetine treatments. These data are relevant for a better understanding of the differential regulation of pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors by corticosterone flattened rhythm.
