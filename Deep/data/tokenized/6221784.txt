The kindling phenomenon, induced by repetitive electrical stimulation of the hippocampus of the rat is associated with the production of a particular behavior: the Wet Dog Shakes (WDS). The evolution of WDS is strongly and negatively correlated with the intensification of motor seizures. Some differences can be seen in the occurrence of WDS according to whether the stimulation is applied in dorsal or in ventral hippocampus. Although the anatomical substrate responsible for this behavior is not clearly defined, the relationship between WDS and kindling let us consider it as an index of the generalization of the epilepsy.
