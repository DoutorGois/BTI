Which brain circuits underlie retrieval of distant memories? Goshen et al. (2011) use a powerful optogenetic-based approach to reveal the critical contribution of the hippocampus to remote memory retrieval. In so doing, they provide new evidence toward resolving a long-standing debate in cognitive neuroscience.
