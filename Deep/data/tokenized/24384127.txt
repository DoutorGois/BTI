The cyclic neuropeptide, somatostatin, is widely expressed in mammalian brain and modulates hormone secretion and neurotransmission. The long-term potentiation (LTP) at Schaffer collateral synapses onto hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons has been intensively studied as a cellular model of learning and memory. The apical (stratum radiatum) and basal dendrites (stratum oriens) of CA1 pyramidal neurons differ in LTP induction and maintenance. Here the role of somatostatin in the modulation of LTP was investigated in rat hippocampus. Our results show that somatostatin enhances LTP in apical and basal dendrites. However, the activation conditions of the somatostatin system are different in these two compartments.
