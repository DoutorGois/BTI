A complementary DNA for human calcineurin A alpha (protein phosphatase-2B), encoding a protein of 521 amino acids, was isolated from a hippocampus library. The deduced human sequence differs from that of mouse in only two amino acids, demonstrating that the structure of this catalytic subunit has been strictly conserved during mammalian evolution. Such high homology is in contrast to that seen for calcineurin A gamma, an isoform that shows only 88% identity between human and mouse (Muramatsu, T. and Kincaid, R.L. (1992) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 188, 265-271).
