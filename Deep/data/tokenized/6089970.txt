The development of bombesin-like peptides and their receptors was determined in 9 different rat brain regions. The concentration of immunoreactive bombesin increased dramatically in all brain regions examined during the third week after birth. In contrast, the density of [125I-Tyr4]bombesin binding sites was near maximal in all brain regions examined by the second postnatal week. These data indicate that the development of receptors precede bombesin-like peptide production.
