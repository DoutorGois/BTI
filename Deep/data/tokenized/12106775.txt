The effect of chronic ethanol consumption during pregnancy and lactation on thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) metabolism was investigated in the hypothalamus and limbic areas of female rats and their weaned pups. Pregnant female rats received ethanol or isocaloric glucose solution during pregnancy either alone, or also during the 3 weeks of lactation. Thyrotropin (TSH) and corticosterone levels were measured in serum; TRH and TRH-gly concentrations were determined in hypothalamus, hippocampus, n.accumbens, frontal cortex and amygdala of dams and pups at 21 days after parturition. Ethanol or glucose consumption during pregnancy and lactation produced a decrease in TSH levels compared with control animals fed at libitum; water replacement during lactation normalized TSH levels only in glucose-fed dams. Pups from ethanol or pair-fed dams showed low weight and increased TSH levels compared with normal rats. Variations in TRH metabolism were detected in limbic areas. Chronic ethanol caused a decrease in the levels of TRH in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of dams. In contrast, glucose chronic ingestion increased TRH content specifically in n.accumbens and amygdala of dams. Most of the variations in TRH content of limbic areas of pups were not specific for glucose or ethanol treatment and correlated with the deleterious effect of the mother's thyroid condition, although some differences were observed depending on pup's gender. These results support the involvement of TRHergic neurons in the limbic system of the female rat exposed to alcohol or glucose during pregnancy and lactation.
