Transient global amnesia (TGA) is a neurological condition which is still a diagnostic challenge for clinicians. Diagnostic clues are an acute onset of a disturbance of memory, a lack of other focal neurological deficits, and repetitive questioning of the patients about time and circumstances. Although the signs and symptoms are quite typical, making the diagnosis of TGA might still be challenging, depending on the patient's characteristics. Taking a precise history from the patient and his/her next of kin is seminal. This article discusses the typical clinical presentation, pathophysiological hypotheses, the diagnostic clues and the most important differential diagnoses.
