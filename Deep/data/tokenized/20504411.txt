The distribution of somatostatin-14 immunoreactivity (SRIF-14-IR) was studied in the hippocampal formation of the human infant. The most prominent accumulation of SRIF-14-IR cell bodies and processes occurred in the CA1 subfield of the stratum oriens in the Ammon's horn, in the hilus of the area dentata, in the deeper layers of the subicular complex and in the entorhinal cortex. SRIF-14-IR neurones are also detected in the angular bundle though they are rare in the alveus and absent in the fimbria.
