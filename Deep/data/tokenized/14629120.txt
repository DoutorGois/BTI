Recently, we have described the developmental expression of the small heat shock proteins (sHsps) Hsp27/HspB1 and alphaB-crystallin/HspB5 in different tissues of pigs from almost full-term foetuses to three years old adults (P. Tallot, J. F. Grongnet, J. C. David, Biol. Neonate, 83, 281-288, 2003). The data described in this report extends this study to four other members of the sHsp family (Hsp20/HspB6, cvHsp/HspB7, MKBP/HspB2 and HspB8). We studied expression of these proteins in porcine lens, brain, heart, liver, kidney, lung, skeletal muscle, stomach, and colon, and found a ubiquitous expression of Hsp20 and HspB8 as earlier reported for Hsp27 and alphaB-crystallin. In contrast, cvHsp and HspB2 expression is essentially restricted to heart and muscle. During development, the sHsps tend to (temporarily) increase in stomach, liver, lung, kidney, hippocampus, and striatum, while expression in heart is more or less constant, and a large variation is found in sHsp expression patterns in skeletal muscle. In cerebellum and cortex a temporary decrease of Hsp20 and HspB8 is observed directly after birth. The major impact of this study is that each tissue seems to have a unique profile of sHsp expression, which varies during development and may reflect the need of a particular tissue to maintain at all stages an optimal chaperoning machinery to protect against physiological stress.
