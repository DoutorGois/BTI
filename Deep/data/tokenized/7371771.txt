Concentrations of 4 trace amines in diencephalon and hippocampus of the rat were measured by integrated-ion-current mass spectrometry after administration of the antidepressant drug, tranylcypromine. Much larger increases were observed for 2-phenylethylamine and tryptamine than for m- and p-tyramine.
