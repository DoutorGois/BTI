The effect of modified and substituted analogues of prolyl-leucyl-glycinamide (PLG, MIF-I) was investigated on the steady-state level of noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) in various brain regions. Proline was replaced by D- or L-pipecolic acid (D- or L-Pip), which analogues in turn were protected by benzoxy-carbonyl (Z) group. Substitution by D- or L-pipecolic acid caused opposite changes in the DA level of the dorsal hippocampus. These effects were absent it the N-terminal of either analogues was protected by Z-group. Following the above mentioned N-terminal modification, the amino group of the C-terminal glycine was also substituted by methyl-esther (Gly-OMe), Z-D-Pip-Leu-Gly-OMe decreased the mesencephalic DA level, while Z-L-Pip-Leu-Gly-OMe increased the 5-HT content of the mesencephalon and striatum. In general, N-terminal substitution by D-pipecolic acid decreased, whereas that by L-pipecolic acid increased the monoamine level in the brain.
