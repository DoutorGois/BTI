Nociceptin binds to nociceptin opioid peptide (NOP) receptors. We reported that although high doses of nociceptin impaired memory function and that these effects were mediated via NOP receptors, low doses of nociceptin attenuated the memory impairment, and these attenuating effects were not mediated via NOP receptors. Even very low doses of nociceptin were biologically active and suggested a certain binding site for this peptide, but the mechanism underlying this attenuating effect has not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the effect of an intrahippocampal injection (i.h.) of nociceptin on memory impairment induced by U0126, a MEK inhibitor, and Rp-cAMPS, a PKA inhibitor in a step-down type passive avoidance test. U0126 (2.63 nmol/mouse, i.h.) impaired memory formation and training-dependent phosphorylation of ERK2 in the hippocampus. Co-administration of nociceptin (10 fmol/mouse) significantly attenuated memory impairment, while it did not attenuate the inhibition of training-dependent phosphorylation of ERK2 induced by U0126. On the other hand, nociceptin did not attenuate memory impairment induced by Rp-cAMPS (0.448 nmol/mouse, i.h.). Nociceptin (1 fmol/mouse) also attenuated U0126 (5.26 nmol/mouse)-induced memory impairment in NOP receptor knockout mice. Nociceptin was reported to metabolize into fragments (1-13) and (14-17) in vivo, which showed pharmacological activities without affecting NOP receptors. Our findings showed that nociceptin (14-17) (1 fmol/mouse) also attenuated U0126-induced memory impairment, while nociceptin (1-13) (0.1-10 fmol/mouse) did not attenuate memory impairment. These results suggest a novel action site or mechanism for the attenuating effects of nociceptin and its metabolite, and the sequence of nociceptin (14-17) is a critical structure.
