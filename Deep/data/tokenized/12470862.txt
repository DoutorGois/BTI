gp120, the coat protein of HIV, can be neurotoxic and is thought to contribute to AIDS-related dementia complex. Such toxicity involves activation of glutamate receptors, mobilization of free cytosolic calcium, and generation of oxygen radicals. We have previously shown that the estrogen 17beta-estradiol, in concentrations of 100 nM or higher, lessens the neurotoxicity of gp120 in hippocampal and cortical cultures, blunts gp120-induced calcium mobilization, and lessens the oxidative consequences. In this study, we examined the protective potential of other estrogens. We found gp120 neurotoxicity in hippocampal cultures to be significantly lessened by estrone, equilin and estriol, although with an order of magnitude less potent than 17beta-estradiol. We also found all four estrogens to blunt gp120-induced calcium mobilization, with estriol being more efficacious than the other three estrogens. These findings give insight both into the mechanisms of estrogenic protection (e.g. receptor-dependent versus independent actions) as well as into the potential therapeutic use of estrogens against AIDS-related dementia complex.
