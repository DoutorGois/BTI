Extracellular beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation and deposition is the main factor, which causes synaptic loss and eventually cells death in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Memory loss and long-term potentiation (LTP) dysfunction in the hippocampus are involved in the AD. The involvement of crocin, as the main and active constituent of saffron extract in learning and memory processes, has been proposed. Here we investigated the probable therapeutic effect of crocin on memory, LTP, and neuronal apoptosis using in vivo Abeta models of the AD. The Abeta peptide (1-42) was bilaterally administered into the frontal-cortex using stereotaxic apparatus. Five hours after surgery, rats were given intraperitoneal crocin (30 mg/kg) daily, which repeated for 12 days. Barnes maze results showed that administration of crocin significantly improves spatial memory indicators such as latency time to achieving the target hole and the number of errors when compared to Abeta-group. Passive avoidance test revealed that crocin significantly increased the step-through-latency compared to Abeta-treated alone. These learning deficits in Abeta-treated animals correlated with a reduction of LTP in hippocampal CA1 synapses in freely moving rats, which crocin improved population spike amplitude and mean field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) slope reduction induced by Abeta. Neuronal apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay and the expression levels of c-Fos proteins were examined by Western blotting. Crocin significantly reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the CA1 region and decreased c-Fos in the hippocampus compared to Abeta-group. In vivo Abeta treatment altered significantly the electrophysiological properties of CA1 neurons and crocin further confirmed a neuroprotective action against Abeta toxicity.
