In mammals and birds, the hippocampus is a major learning and memory center that plays a prominent role in spatial memory, the use of distal cues to guide navigation. The role of reptilian hippocampal homologues, the medial and dorsal cortex, in spatial memory has not been thoroughly investigated. The medial and dorsal cortex of reptiles is known to play a role in learning both tasks that are hippocampally dependent and tasks that are not hippocampally dependent in mammals and birds. In order to examine the specific role of the medial and dorsal cortex in spatial memory, we trained medial cortex, dorsal cortex, and sham lesioned Cnemidophorus inornatus lizards to locate the one heated rock of four identical rocks spaced evenly around the perimeter of a circular, sand filled, arena in a cool room. We used probe trials to examine the strategies used by lizards to locate the goal. Medial cortex lesions and dorsal cortex lesions slowed acquisition and altered the strategies used to locate the goal. However, none of the lizards adopted a spatial strategy to locate the goal suggesting that the dorsal cortex and medial cortex are involved in using non-spatial strategies for navigation.
