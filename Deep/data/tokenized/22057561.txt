Nitric oxide (*NO) is a ubiquitous signaling molecule that participates in neuromolecular phenomena associated with memory formation as well as in excitotoxicity. In the hippocampus, neuronal *NO production is coupled to the activation of the NMDA-type of glutamate receptor. More recently, Cytochrome c oxidase has emerged as a novel target for *NO, which competes with O 2 for binding to this mitochondrial complex. This reaction establishes *NO not only as a regulator of cellular metabolism but possibly also as a regulator of mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species which participate in cellular signaling. A major gap in the understanding of *NO bioactivity, namely, in the hippocampus, has been the lack of knowledge of its concentration dynamics. Here, we present a detailed description of the simultaneous recording of *NO and O2 concentration dynamics in rat hippocampal slices. Carbon fi ber microelectrodes are fabricated and applied for real-time measurements of both gases in a system close to in vivo models. This approach allows for a better understanding of the current paradigm by which an intricate interplay between *NO and O 2 regulates cellular respiration.
