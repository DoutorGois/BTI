Effect of chronic restraint stress on the number of dendritic spines and excrescences of hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons has been investigated. The results revealed a significant increase in the number of dendritic spines of apical and basal dendrites in rats subjected to restraint stress (6 h per day for 21 days). The number of excrescences were also markedly increased in stressed rats. The physiological significance and possible mechanism for increased spine density is discussed.
