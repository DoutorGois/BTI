We consider the mechanisms by which coherent activity arises in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, two brain areas that are associated with episodic memory in humans and similar forms of memory in animal models. Our approach relies upon techniques from the theory of coupled oscillators. We show that such techniques can yield accurate predictions of the behavior of synaptically coupled neurons. Future work will expand upon these techniques to include real-world complications that better mimic the in vivo state.
