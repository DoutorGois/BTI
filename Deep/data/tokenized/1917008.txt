Effect of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) ethanol on pre-optic area (POA) and hippocampus (HPC) was investigated by recording chronological changes in their electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, through chronically implanted cannulae and bipolar electrodes, in five conscious male beagle dogs. Recordings were made for two hours after microinjection and compared with cortical (CO) tracings. The predominant pattern of EEG activity from subcortical loci was high voltage discharges though synchronization was also observed. Cortical EEG depicted slow waves with some potentiation. The study demonstrated similar type of response form POA and HPC, which was different from CO, suggesting that ethanol produces different actions at subcortical and cortical level.
