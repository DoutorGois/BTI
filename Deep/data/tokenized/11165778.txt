The effect of priming for audiogenic seizures (AGS) on the development of epileptiform activity in the hippocampus was studied using in vitro kindling (IVK) in Long-Evans rats. AGS priming consists of intense auditory stimulation during a critical period of auditory development, resulting in sound-induced clonic convulsions upon subsequent testing. Between postnatal day (PND) 28 and 50, slices from subjects primed and sham-primed for AGS on PND 18 were used for recording responses in area CA1 of hippocampus following Schaffer collateral stimulation from stratum radiatum of area CA2/CA3. The developmental priming procedure, which enhances auditory brainstem excitability, resulted in fewer afterdischarges in slices from primed subjects across initial IVK stimulation sequences. These results suggest that changes in excitability that occur with acoustic priming can initially diminish selective epileptiform response characteristics in forebrain areas such as the hippocampus.
