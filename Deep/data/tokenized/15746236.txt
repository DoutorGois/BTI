Transient global amnesia is a benign syndrome of sudden-onset alteration of behavior with temporary dysfunction of anterograde and recent retrograde memory. Its neural substrates remain uncertain. Possible causes include ischemia, migraine, and epilepsy. The authors report a case of a 62-year-old man with a transient attack of memory disturbance, suggestive of transient global amnesia, in which magnetic resonance imaging performed 48 hours after onset showed left mesial temporal lobe signal changes on diffusion-weighted imaging and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. The findings and a literature review lend further support to the ischemic pathogenesis of transient global amnesia as a possible etiology, and underscore the role of diffusion-weighted imaging in the diagnosis of this condition.
