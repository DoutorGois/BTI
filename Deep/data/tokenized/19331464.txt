C57BL/6 mice were given 0.2% cuprizone (CPZ) for 2 to 6 weeks while controls ate the same diet without CPZ. At various time points the animals were subjected to behavioral tests and their brains were analyzed. Mice exposed to CPZ for 2 and 3 weeks displayed more climbing behavior and lower prepulse inhibition, suggesting an increase in central nervous system activity and impaired sensorimotor gating. In addition, they showed lower activities of monoamine oxidase and dopamine beta hydroxylase in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, and had higher dopamine but lower norepinephrine levels in the prefrontal cortex. Mice exposed to CPZ for 4 to 6 weeks had less social interaction, which is an animal correlate of social withdrawal of patients with schizophrenia. Also, these CPZ-exposed mice showed evident brain demyelination, myelin break down, and loss of oligodendrocytes. At all time points the CPZ-exposed mice spent more time in the open arms of an elevated plus maze and exhibited spatial working memory impairment. These data are in line with evidence from human studies suggesting a putative role of white matter abnormality in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.
