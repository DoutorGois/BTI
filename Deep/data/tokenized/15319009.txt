Recent experimental evidence indicates that erythropoietin (Epo), in addition to its hormonal role in regulating red cell production, operates as a neuroprotective agent. So far, the neuroprotective effect of human recombinant Epo (rhEpo) has been mainly demonstrated in models of cerebral ischemia/hypoxia and in selected in vivo studies of traumatic neuronal injury. To further investigate the potential role of this multifunctional trophic factor in post-traumatic cell death, we examined the protective effects of rhEpo in a newly developed model of mechanical trauma in organotypic hippocampal slices. Organotypic rat hippocampal slices were subjected to traumatic injury by allowing a stylus to impact on the CA1 area with an energy of 6 microJ. Hippocampal damage was identified and measured 24 and 48 h later with the fluorescent dye propidium iodide (PI). In untreated slices, the impact induced a significant increase in the mean hippocampal PI fluorescence, co-localized with the area of impact at 24 h (primary post-traumatic injury) and progressively spread to the whole slice between 24 and 48 h (secondary post-traumatic injury). Addition of rhEpo (1-100 UI/mL) or of the NMDA antagonist MK-801 (30 microM) immediately after the traumatic injury reduced hippocampal damage by approximately 30% when observed 24 h later. At 48 h after trauma, the protective effect of rhEpo was greater (by about 47%) and significantly more pronounced than that of MK-801 (28%). Our results suggest that the neuroprotective activity of rhEpo is particularly effective against delayed, secondary post-traumatic damage. This well tolerated agent could provide a therapeutic benefit in pathologies involving post-traumatic neurodegeneration.
