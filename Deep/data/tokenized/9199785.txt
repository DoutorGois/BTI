Spontaneously occurring synaptic events (synaptic noise) recorded intracellularly are usually assumed to be independent of evoked postsynaptic responses and to contaminate measures of postsynaptic response amplitude in a roughly Gaussian manner. Here we derive analytically the expected noise distribution for excitatory synaptic noise and investigate its effects on amplitude histograms. We propose that some fraction of this excitatory noise is initiated at the same release sites that contribute to the evoked synaptic event and develop an analytical model of the interaction between this fraction of the noise and the evoked postsynaptic response amplitude. Recording intracellularly with sharp microelectrodes in the in vitro hippocampal slice preparation, we find that excitatory synaptic noise accounts for up to 70% of the intracellular recording noise, when inhibition is blocked pharmacologically. Up to 20% of this noise shows a significant correlation with the evoked event amplitude, and the behavior of this component of the noise is consistent with a model which assumes that each release site experiences a refractory period of approximately 60 ms after release. In contrast with classical models of quantal variance, our models predict that excitatory synaptic noise can cause the apparent variance of successive peaks in an excitatory synaptic amplitude histogram to decrease from left to right, and in some cases to be less than the variance of the measured noise.
