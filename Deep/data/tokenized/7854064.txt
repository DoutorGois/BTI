We studied the localization of 63-kDa Ca2+/calmodulin stimulated phosphodiesterase mRNA in the rat brain by in situ hybridization histochemistry using an oligonucleotides probe specific to this enzyme. The signals were especially concentrated in several brain regions such as the olfactory tubercle, accumbens nucleus, caudate putamen, fundus striati, dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, pontine nuclei and dorsal tegmental nucleus. These results suggest that in the neuronal groups containing the strong signals this enzyme is involved in calcium-dependent signal transduction system coupled to cyclic nucleotides messenger systems.
