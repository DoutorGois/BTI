Neurod1 is a transcription factor involved in several developmental programs of the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, neurosensory, and central nervous system. In the brain, Neurod1 has been shown to be essential for neurogenesis as well as migration, maturation, and survival of newborn neurons during development and adulthood. Interestingly, Neurod1 expression is maintained in a subset of fully mature neurons where its function remains unclear. To study the role of Neurod1, systems are required that allow the temporal and spatial genetic manipulation of Neurod1-expressing cells. To this aim, we have generated four Neurod1-CreER(T2) mouse lines in which CreER(T2) expression, although at different levels, is restricted within areas of physiological Neurod1 expression and Neurod1 positive cells. In particular, the different levels of CreER(T2) expression in different mouse lines offers the opportunity to select the one that is more suited for a given experimental approach. Hence, our Neurod1-CreER(T2) lines provide valuable new tools for the manipulation of newborn neurons during development and adulthood as well as for studying the subpopulation of mature neurons that retain Neurod1 expression throughout life. In this context, we here report that Neurod1 is not only expressed in immature newborn neurons of the adult hippocampus, as already described, but also in fully mature granule cells of the dentate gyrus.
