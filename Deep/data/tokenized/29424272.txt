BACKGROUND: Hippocampus (HIP) was an important limbic structure, and concurrent emotion disorders may occur in medication-overuse headache (MOH) patients. The aim of this study is to investigate altered HIP and HIP subfields volume in relation with the anxiety in MOH patients using a state-of-the-art hippocampal segment method. RESULTS: The current study presented that a significant lower HIP and HIP subfields volume were identified in MOH compared with that NC except right HIP tail, bilateral parasubiculums and HIP fissure. The left HIP and right subiculum presented negative correlation with headache variables, and the right subiculum, CA4, GC-DG, and bilateral CA1, molecular layer and whole HIP presented negative correlation with HAMA score, which were further confirmed by the linear regression analysis with the exclusion of psychological variables and headache variables, respectively.
