Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is a novel identified chromatin-associated cytokine of IL-1 family cytokines. It signals through a heterodimer comprised of ST2L and IL-1RAcp, and plays a crucial role in many diseases. However, very little is known about the role and underlying intricate mechanisms of IL-33 in recurrent neonatal seizure (RNS). To determine whether IL-33 plays an important regulatory role, we established a neonatal seizure model in this study. Rats were subjected to recurrent seizures induced by inhaling volatile flurothyl. Recombinant IL-33 or PBS were also administered by intraperitoneally (IP) before surgery, respectively. Here, our current results indicated that RNS contributed to a significant reduction in IL-33 and its specific receptor (ST2L) expressions in cortex. While, in hippocampus, RNS induced an increase in IL-33 and ST2L evidently, compared with Sham group. After injection with IL-33, however, a remarkable increase in total IL-33 was detected both in brain cortex and hippocampus. In addition, IL-33 was mainly co-localized in the nuclear of GFAP(+) astrocytes and the cytoplasm of the Iba-1(+) microglia and IL-33(+)/NeuN(+) merged cells. In parallel, ST2L was expressed mainly in the membrane of GFAP(+) astrocytes, Iba-1(+) microglia and NeuN(+) neurons, respectively. Furthermore, administration of IL-33 improved RNS-induced behavioral deficits, promoted bodyweight gain, and ameliorated spatial learning and memory ability. Moreover, IL-33 pretreatment blocked the activation of NF-kappaB, resisted inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha increase, as well as suppressed apoptosis and autophagy activation after RNS. Collectively, IL-33 provides potential neuroprotection through suppressing apoptosis, autophagy and at least in part by NF-kappaB-mediated inflammatory pathways after RNS.
