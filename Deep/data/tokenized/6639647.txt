Male rats aged 8 weeks received intraventricular injections of 100 microCi (3.7 MBq) L-[1-3H] fucose each, 7 h after acquisition of a brightness discrimination task. Two, 8 and 24 h as well as 16, 29 and 60 days after injection of labelled fucose hippocampal tissue was prepared to obtain Tris-soluble, Triton-soluble and Triton-resistant fractions. Two and 8 h after application of [3H]fucose, the trained animals revealed an increased incorporation of fucose mainly into the Triton-soluble glycoproteins. However, it is considered that also material from the Tris-soluble fraction may be used as an additional precursor for Triton-soluble glycoproteins. Quantitative analysis of autoradiographic densitograms obtained after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed the occurrence of a training-related increase in fucose incorporation predominantly into the slow-moving Triton-soluble glycoproteins. The latter exhibited a higher turnover rate than the faster-moving glycoproteins. For the longer incorporation times (days) after injection of labelled fucose, no differences were observed between trained animals and corresponding active and passive controls.
