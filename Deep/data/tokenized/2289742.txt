3H-nipecotic acid (3H-NIP) binding to GABA uptake recognition sites was studied in the hippocampus of 3 groups of male, Long Evans rats: Group 1: ethanol-naive rats (ENR); Group II: ethanol-preferring rats (DR) and non-preferring rats (NDR), which had consumed about 5 g.kg-1.d-1 and 1 g-1.d-1 of alcohol respectively in the form of a 12% ethanol solution prior to 3H-NIP binding analysis; Group III: DR and NDR who had had no access to ethanol for 21 d after the initial exposure of ethanol solution (28 d). Binding studies showed that ethanol drunk by both DR and NDR in Group II decreased 3H-NIP binding (Bmax decreased) with an enhancement of affinity (KD decreased). In rats subjected to withdrawal of ethanol (Group III), affinity of 3H-NIP for GABA uptake sites was higher than in controls (Group I), but lower than in Group II, Bmax in this group being higher than in the 2 other groups. In Group III, KD was higher in DR than in NDR. These results showed that ethanol intake, in a free-choice paradigm, altered 3H-NIP binding, and that differences in ethanol intake between DR and NDR were associated with differences in sensitivity of hippocampal GABA uptake sites. These differences in 3H-NIP binding could either precede ethanol intake, or be a direct result from it. The results, together with data from other laboratories suggest that: 1), 3H-NIP binding sites are involved in the regulation of ethanol intake; 2), 1 factor responsible for individual differences in ethanol response is reflected by the GABA uptake system.
