In this study, 13 groups of rats were injected with the insecticide Disulfoton (0-0-diethyl S-2-[(ethylthio) ethyl] phosphorodithioate), sacrificed after various time intervals and levels of hippocampal norepinephrine determined. Results indicate that this cholinesterase inhibiting compound caused a significant decrease (congruent to 14%) in hippocampal norepinephrine within 3 hours of exposure. This reduction was maintained for at least 48 hours. Titers of norepinephrine had returned to control levels when measured 5 days after a single drug administration. Chronic poisoning also caused depressed norepinephrine levels, although not significantly below those observed in acutely treated animals.
