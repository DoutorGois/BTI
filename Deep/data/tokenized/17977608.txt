The hippocampal formation plays an essential role in associative learning like passive avoidance (PA) learning. It has been shown; orexin-containing terminals and orexin receptors densely are distributed in the hippocampal formation. We have previously demonstrated that antagonization of orexin 1 receptor (OX1R) in CA1 region of hippocampus and dentate gyrus (DG) impaired spatial memory processing. Although, there are few studies concerning function of orexinergic system on memory processing in PA task, but there is no study about physiological function of OX1R on this process. To address this, the OX1R antagonist, SB-334867-A, was injected into DG or CA1 regions of hippocampus and evaluated the influence of OX1R antagonization on acquisition, consolidation and retrieval in PA task. Our results show that, SB-334867-A administration into CA1 region impaired memory retrieval but not PA acquisition and consolidation. However, SB-334867-A administration into DG region impaired acquisition and consolidation but not PA memory retrieval. Therefore, it seems that endogenous orexins play an important role in learning and memory in the rat through OX1Rs.
