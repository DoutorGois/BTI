Sodium succinate has been studied for its influence on the efficiency of glutamate transmission in the Schaffer collateral synapses and duration of its potentiation state caused by high-frequency stimulation in surviving hippocampal slices. It is shown that administration of sodium succinate (50 mg/kg i. p.) to rats 30 min prior to decapitation stabilizes glutamate transmission in field CA1 of the rat hippocampal slices and increases duration of its potentiation state.
