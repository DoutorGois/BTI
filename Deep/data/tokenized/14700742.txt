Neurofilament inclusion disease (NID) is a novel neurodegenerative disease characterized histologically by the presence of neurofilament positive neuronal inclusions (NI) and swollen achromatic neurons (SN). The density and distribution of NI and SN were studied in areas of the temporal lobe in four cases of NID. In NID, the density of the NI and SN was greater in areas of the cerebral cortex compared with the hippocampus and dentate gyrus. Lesion densities were similar in the different gyri of the temporal cortex and in the various cornu ammonis sectors of the hippocampus. In the cerebral cortex, the density of the NI and SN was greater in the lower compared with the upper cortical laminae. There was no significant correlation between the densities of the NI and SN. The distribution of the temporal lobe pathology of NID has several differences from that reported in Pick's disease and corticobasal degeneration supporting the hypothesis that NID is a novel and unique type of neurodegenerative disease.
