Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) has many attributes which make it attractive as a base for the development of vectors for the delivery of transgenes to the nervous system. In this report we describe the adaptation of the bipartite GAL4:VP16 transactivation system to replication-deficient HSV vectors. We demonstrate that the recombinant transactivator GAL4:VP16 produced from a replication-deficient HSV vector is capable of activating transcription of a reporter gene using a synthetic promoter consisting of GAL4 binding sites and the TATA box of the adenovirus E1b gene. Activation by vector produced GAL:VP16 was demonstrated with the recombinant promoter/reporter gene cassette in the infected cell chromosome, in the genome of a second virus infecting the same cells and with a single vector engineered to produce both GAL4:VP16 transactivator and to contain a recombinant promoter/reporter gene cassette. Furthermore, the double recombinant virus also produced the reporter gene product in neurons after direct intracranial inoculation into rat hippocampus. This system may be used to extend and improve promoter function in HSV gene transfer vectors in vivo.
