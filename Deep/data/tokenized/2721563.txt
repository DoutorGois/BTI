The intracerebroventricular injection of 0.5 mg of vincristine sulphate in adult male Wistar rats caused within 11 days the impairment of motor and reflexive behavior, evaluated by the elevated platform and hanging wire tests, a decrease in food consumption and loss of body weight, a 45% decrease in hippocampal choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity and a 35% decrease in the rate of high-affinity choline uptake (HACU) in the injected side. The latter effects are due to the death of neurons in the respective hemiseptum. Intrafimbrial injection of vincristine caused the same decrease in ChAT activity without behavioral alterations. Daily i.p. administration of GM1 ganglioside, beginning immediately after the vincristine injection, prevented dose dependently the decrease in ChAT activity and HACU rate. Prevention was complete with the 60 mg/kg dose. The same dose was equally active on ChAT activity when given s.c. but was inactive p.o. The ChAT decrease was also prevented when GM1 treatment began 5 days after vincristine. GM1 60 mg/kg i.p. also reduced the behavioral toxicity of vincristine. The possibility that GM1 might prevent vincristine toxicity by antagonizing its disruption of neurofilaments and axonal flow is discussed.
