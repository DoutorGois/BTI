An intracranial lipomatous hamartoma was found in the third ventricle of a 7-week-old female BALB/cAnNCrlCrlj mouse. The nodule was composed of mature white adipose cells, which contained one large fat droplet, and there was no evidence of cytological atypia. The brain parenchyma at the retrosplenial granular cortex and the hippocampus in the cerebrum were slightly compressed, and the choroid plexus was dislocated downward. Scattered capillary vessels penetrated the nodule from the surrounding tissue. Based on these findings, the lesion was diagnosed as a lipomatous hamartoma that occurred from the roof of the third ventricle. This extremely rare tumor-like nodule represents an overgrowth of the mature adipocyte population as a malformation rather than a true neoplasm.
