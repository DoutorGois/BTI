By means of scanning cytospectrophotometry of gallocyanin chrome alum stained sections, cytoplasmic RNA content per cell in the neurons of the ground squirrel hippocampus, hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus, and spinal cord anterior horns, was shown to decrease as far as the hibernation went on. Before the arousal the RNA amount increased, the increase being the greatest in the hypothalamic neurons. First days after the arousal, the cytoplasmic RNA content in all the neurons was significantly higher than in the same neurons before the hibernation. Changes of RNA content in the neurons and in the homogenates of corresponding brain areas were compared; important role of the hypothalamus in metabolic reconstruction of the nervous system at various stages of hibernation, was outlined.
