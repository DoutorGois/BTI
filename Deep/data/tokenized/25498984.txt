Structural and functional neuronal plasticity could play a crucial role during the course of multiple sclerosis (MS). The immune system and the central nervous system (CNS) strictly interact in physiologic conditions and during inflammation to modulate neuroplasticity and in particular the ability of the synapses to undergo long-term changes in the efficacy of synaptic transmission, such as long-term potentiation (LTP). During MS, neuro-inflammation might deeply influence the ability of neuronal networks to express physiologic plasticity, reducing the plastic reserve of the brain, with a negative impact on symptoms progression and cognitive performances. In this manuscript we review the evidence on synaptic plasticity alterations in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the most diffuse and widely utilized experimental model of MS, together with their potential underlying mechanisms and clinical relevance.
