In this study Mongolian gerbils were submitted to a normothermic bilateral carotid ligation lasting 5 min. A noncompetitive antagonist of NMDA receptors, MK-801, 0.8 mg/kg, was injected i.p. 30 min before ischemia, or the ganglioside GM1, 30 mg/kg, was given i.p. for 3 days, twice a day. The morphology of the hippocampal CA1 neurones and the brain content of cyclooxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid: prostaglandin 6-keto PGF1 alpha and thromboxane Tx B2 were studied. Untreated ischemia induced the accumulation in brain of the 6-keto PGF1 alpha and Tx B2 immunoreactive materials, and resulted in a lesion of 70% of CA1 neurones. In the MK-801- and GM1-pretreated groups the postischemic levels of Tx B2 were significantly decreased. However MK-801 and GM1 did not prevent damage to the CA1 neurones in gerbils normothermic after ischemia, whereas a partial neuroprotection was observed in hypothermic, MK-801 treated gerbils. The results of this study indicate that NMDA receptors may participate in the mechanism of postischemic release of eicosanoids in brain. They also confirm a potential modulatory role of gangliosides. These results are discussed in terms of the involvement of cyclooxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid in the mechanism of a selective delayed neuronal damage to the hippocampus CA1 after ischemia.
