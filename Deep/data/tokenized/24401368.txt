BACKGROUND: Aging is associated with the gradual cognitive decline and shows the typical senile plaque formation in the brain, which results from the aggregation of beta amyloid (Abeta) peptide following the abnormal proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-secretase (BACE1) and gamma-secretase. Accumulating evidence indicates that several microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) by regulating the expression of APP and BACE1 proteins. However, the cognitive ability and the expression profile of the APP- and BACE1-associated miRNAs in the middle-aged population are largely unknown. METHODS: The learning and memory ability in rats were determined by Morris Water Maze test. The protein levels of APP and BACE1 were detected by western blotting. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to identify the miRNAs levels in forebrain cortex and the hippocampus. RESULTS: Middle-aged rats have declined learning ability without changes in the memory ability, and increased APP and BACE1 protein expression in the forebrain cortex. Computational analysis using Targetscan and Pictar databases reveals that totally 4 predicted miRNAs have conserved binding site with APP, namely miR-106b, -17-5p, -153, -101. All of them showed decreased expression in both the forebrain cortex and hippocampus. Among the 10 predicted miRNAs targeting BACE1, different expression profiles were identified in the forebrain cortex (decreased: miR-9, -19a, -135a, -15b, -16, -195, -29c, -214; increased: miR-124; no change: miR-141) and the hippocampus (decreased: miR-9, -15b, -16, -195, -29c, -124; increased: miR-19a, -135a, -214, -141) in the middle-aged rats compared with the young rats. CONCLUSION: Our results provided the first evidence that middle-aged rats have begun displaying cognitive disability with abnormal expression of APP- and BACE1-related miRNAs in the hippocampus and forebrain cortex.
