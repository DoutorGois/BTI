The study was made of hypothalamic and hippocampal lipid composition in sudden death of ischemic heart disease. Biochemical findings rest on the evidence obtained at thin-layer chromatography. Lipid disorders of the hippocampal cell structures were primarily related to cholesterol fractures. Hippocampal metabolism was impaired in phospholipids metabolism. These biochemical changes entailed changes in ultrastructure which may represent one of the central mechanisms of a sudden cardiac death.
