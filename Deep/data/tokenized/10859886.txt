The influence of chronic ethanol intoxication on the terminal vascularization of particular hippocampal fields and layers was investigated in different age groups of rats. Thirty-six male Wistar rats aged 6 weeks were used in the study. For twelve months 24 of them drank only 25% ethanol--12 starting at 6-week-age and 12 at 3-month-age. The control group of 12 rats drank only water. As an effect of long-term ethanol exposure on hippocampal capillaries we observed the increase in the terminal vessel diameter and the decrease in microvascular length, surface, and volume densities. These changes varied between different age groups and between particular hippocampal regions. The observed age and regional differentiation of ethanol-related microvascular changes did not correlate well with the damaging effects of alcohol on corresponding neuronal elements, which emphasizes the very complicated pathogenesis of ethanol-induced injuries.
