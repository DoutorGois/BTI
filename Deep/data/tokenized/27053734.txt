In this review article, we address how activity-dependent Ca(2+)signaling is crucial for hippocampal synaptic/structural plasticity and discuss how changes in neuronal oxidative state affect Ca(2+)signaling and synaptic plasticity. We also analyze current evidence indicating that oxidative stress and abnormal Ca(2+)signaling contribute to age-related synaptic plasticity deterioration.
