gamma-Amino butyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors are the major sites of fast synaptic inhibition in the brain. GABAA receptors play an important role in regulating neuronal excitability and in addition have been implicated in numerous neurological disorders. In order to understand synaptic inhibition it is important to comprehend the cellular mechanisms, that neurons utilize to regulate the accumulation and regulation of GABAA receptors at postsynaptic inhibitory specializations. Over the past decade a number of GABAA receptor interacting proteins have been identified allowing us to further understand the trafficking, targeting and clustering of these receptors as well as the regulation of receptor stability. In the following review we examine the proteins identified as GABAA receptor binding partners and other components of the inhibitory postsynaptic scaffold, and how they contribute to the construction of inhibitory synapses and the dynamic modulation of synaptic inhibition.
