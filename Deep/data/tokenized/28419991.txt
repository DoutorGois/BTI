OBJECTIVES: This study was intended to investigate whether treatment with resveratrol and melatonin alone or in combination can exert neurorestorative effects in a rat model of vascular dementia. METHODS: Briefly, male Wistar rats were subjected to permanent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) by surgery. After 4 weeks, the cognitive deficits were assessed using the Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests. The biochemical parameters of oxidative stress and inflammation were also assessed. RESULTS: Rats in the BCCAO group showed cognitive deficits, accompanied by oxidonitrosative stress, neuroinflammation, and a reduction in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus region. Moreover, the acetylcholinesterase activity in the hippocampus was found to be increased in the BCCAO group compared to the sham group. The 4-week treatment with melatonin (10 mg/kg) and resveratrol (20 mg/kg) alone and in combination (melatonin 5 mg/kg and reseveratrol 10 mg/kg) caused a significant improvement in the cognitive deficits induced by BCCAO, accompanied by a reversal of oxidonitrosative stress, neuroinflammation, and BDNF depletion in the hippocampus region. Additionally, the treatment with melatonin and resveratrol significantly decreased acetylcholinesterase activity compared to in the BCCAO group. Melatonin and resveratrol ameliorated the BDNF expression of hippocampal protein. CONCLUSION: These results emphasize that coadministration of melatonin and resveratrol can be beneficial in BCCAO-induced vascular dementia through changes in BDNF expressions.
