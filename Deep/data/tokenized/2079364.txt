Experimental epilepsy was induced in developing normal, undernourished and subsequently rehabilitated rats by locally injecting graded doses of Kainic acid (KA) in the right frontal cortex. Frequency and power spectral analysis of EEG was carried out to assess the progressive changes in EEG during KA-epileptogenesis. Undernourished animals were highly susceptible to seizure discharge. They exhibited generalized tonic-clonic discharge and had episodes of clinical seizures even after temporary neuronal recovery. Increase in power of delta, theta and decrease in alpha power was observed in the compressed spectral array (CSA) of undernourished animals. Delayed neuronal recovery with reduced background EEG and marked electrosilence in response to intra-rectal sodium valproate was observed in undernourished animals. Rehabilitated animals exhibited partial recovery which was related to the body weight gain. Spike frequency, spike amplitude and neuronal recovery time were not significantly differet between normal and undernourished animals at lower doses of KA (7.5-60 ng) whereas at higher doses (120-500 ng) marked differences were observed in these parameters. In KA treated undernourished rats 3H-glycine incorporation was significantly higher than normal in the hippocampus and spinal cord and lower in the cerebellum.
