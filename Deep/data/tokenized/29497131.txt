The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) plays a critical role in episodic memory, but the molecular mechanisms governing plasticity in this structure are poorly understood. Diverse studies have demonstrated a role for RSC in acquisition, early consolidation and retrieval similar to the hippocampus (HC), as well as in systems consolidation similar to the anterior cingulate cortex. Here, we asked whether established molecular and structural substrates of memory consolidation in the HC also engage in RSC shortly after learning. We show striking parallels in training induced gene-activation in HC and RSC following contextual conditioning, which is blocked by systemic administration of an NMDA receptor antagonist. Long-term memory is enhanced by retrosplenial and hippocampal knockdown (KD) of the cAMP specific phosphodiesterase Pde4d. However, while training per se induces lasting spine changes in HC, this does not occur in RSC. Instead, increases in the number of mature dendritic spines are found in the RSC only if cAMP signaling is augmented by Pde4d KD, and spine changes are at least partially independent of training. This research highlights parallels and differences in spine plasticity mechanisms between HC and RSC, and provides evidence for a functional dissociation of the two.
