A role of cholinergic nervous system in the behavioral impairments induced by repeated ECS is not understood. The alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist ABT-418, but not the alpha7 nAChR agonist, significantly ameliorated the impairment of spontaneous alternation behavior in the Y-maze test. And, repeated ECS caused a reduction of alpha4 nAChR-positive cells in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Thus, the alpha4beta2 nAChR is related to ECS-induced deficits in rats.
