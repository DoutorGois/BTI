1 The release of endogenous gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) from slices of rat cortex, hippocampus and striatum prepared both 30 min and 24 h after the last of a series of electroconvulsive shocks (5 seizures given spread out over 10 days) has been investigated. 2 No change in spontaneous (basal) release was observed. However, 30 min after the last convulsion, K+-evoked GABA release above basal release was inhibited in both hippocampus (20%) and striatum (33%) but not in the cortex. Release was still inhibited in striatum (22%) 24 h after the last seizure. 3 In confirmation of an earlier report, chronic electroconvulsive shock was found to increase basal GABA content in striatum and inhibit synthesis by 34%. The synthesis rate was also inhibited in the hippocampus (44%) but not in the cortex. 4 Glutamic acid decarboxylase activity was unchanged in all regions after repeated electroconvulsive shock treatment. 5 It is proposed that repeated electroconvulsive shocks lead to a substantial inhibition of release in the striatum and hippocampus and a long-term inhibition of GABA synthesis in these regions. Such changes may be associated with the altered monoamine biochemistry and function observed after repeated electroconvulsive shock and with the mechanism of the antidepressant action of electroconvulsive therapy.
