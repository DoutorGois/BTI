Nowadays, a consensus has been reached that designates the functional and structural reorganization of synapses as the primary mechanisms underlying the process of recovery from brain injury. We have reported that pontine noradrenaline (NA) is increased in animals after cortical ablation (CA). The aim of the present study was to explore the noradrenergic and morphological response after sensorimotor intervention (SMI) in rats injured in the motor cortex. We used male Wistar adult rats allocated in four conditions: sham-operated, injured by cortical ablation, sham-operated with SMI and injured by cortical ablation with SMI. Motor and somatosensory performance was evaluated prior to and 20 days after surgery. During the intervening period, a 15-session, SMI program was implemented. Subsequently, total NA analysis in the pons and dentate gyrus (DG) was performed. All groups underwent histological analysis. Our results showed that NA content in the DG was reduced in the injured group versus control, and this reduction was reverted in the injured group that underwent SMI. Moreover, injured rats showed reduction in the number of granule cells in the DG and decreased dentate granule cell layer thickness. Notably, after SMI, the loss of granule cells was reverted. Locus coeruleus showed turgid cells in the injured rats. These results suggest that SMI elicits biochemical and structural modifications in the hippocampus that could reorganize the system and lead the recovery process, modulating structural and functional plasticity.
