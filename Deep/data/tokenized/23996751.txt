OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mechanism of beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) in regulating the expression of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). METHODS: Abeta1-40 was injected into the bilateral hippocampus of rats, and 3 weeks later, the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were detected by flow cytometry. The expressions of RAGE, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases (gp9l(phox) and p47(phox)), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), and inhibitor of kappaB (IkappaB) were measured by Western blotting. RESULTS: Injection of Abeta1-40 caused a significant increase in the expressions of RAGE, gp9l(phox), p47(phox), phospho-p47(phox), phospho-IkappaBalpha, NF-kappaB and phospho-NF-kappaB in rat hippocampus but decreased the level of IkappaBalpha. Abeta1-40 injection also resulted in a significantly increased content of ROS in the hippocampus of the rats. CONCLUSION: Abeta up-regulates the expression of RAGE in rat hippocampus via NADPH/ ROS/NF-kappaB signaling pathway.
