There is substantial evidence for the involvement of the hippocampus and subcortical regions in the neuropathology of schizophrenia. Deficits of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) have been found in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder which may reflect neuronal loss and/or dysfunction. N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) is the most abundant peptide transmitter in the mammalian nervous system. It is an agonist at presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR3, inhibiting glutamate release. NAA and NAAG and were measured in hippocampal, striatal, amygdala and cingulate gyrus regions of human postmortem tissue from controls and subjects with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. There are significant deficits in hippocampal NAA concentrations in all patient groups. In the amygdala there are significant NAA deficits in schizophrenia and depression and significant deficits of NAAG in the amygdala in the depression group. The deficits in NAA reported in this study confirm the importance of hippocampal and other subcortical structures in the neuropathology of the major psychiatric disorders.
