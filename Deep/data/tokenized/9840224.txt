The effects of neurotensin (NT) on the release of acetylcholine (ACh), aspartate (Asp), glutamate (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) from the hippocampus of freely moving rats were studied by transversal microdialysis. ACh was detected by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection while GABA, glutamate and aspartate were measured using HPLC with fluorometric detection. Neurotensin (0.2 and 0.5 microM) administered locally through the microdialysis probe to the hippocampus produced a long-lasting and concentration-dependent increase in the basal extracellular levels of GABA and ACh but not of glutamate and aspartate. The increase in the extracellular levels of GABA and ACh produced by 0.5 microM neurotensin in the hippocampus reached a maximum of about 310% for GABA and 250% for ACh. This stimulant effect of NT was antagonized by the NT receptor antagonist SR 48692 (100 microg/kg, i.p.). Local infusion of tetrodotoxin (1 microM) decreased the basal release of ACh, GABA, Asp, Glu and prevented the 0.2 microM NT-induced increase in GABA and ACh release. The effect of NT on the release of ACh was blocked by the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline (2-10 microM). Our findings indicate for the first time that neurotensin plays a neuromodulatory role in the regulation of GABAergic and cholinergic neuronal activity in the hippocampus of awake and freely moving rats. The potentiating effects of neurotensin on GABA and ACh release in the hippocampus are probably mediated by (i) NT receptors located on GABAergic cell bodies and (ii) through GABA(A) receptors located on cholinergic nerve terminals.
