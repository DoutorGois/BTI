Mice injected with LPS (10 mu g/mouse, sc) or saline were submitted to a 15-min restraint stress and sacrificed 1 or 2 h later to assess the effect of stress on the induction of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and other proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1alpha, IL-1ra, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) in the spleen, pituitary, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and striatum. LPS-induced cytokine gene expression, as determined by comparative RT-PCR, was lower in stressed than in nonstressed mice. LPS increased plasma and tissue levels of IL-1beta, as determined by ELISA, but this effect was less marked in stressed than in nonstressed mice. These results are discussed in relation to the modulatory effects of glucocorticoids on cytokine production.
