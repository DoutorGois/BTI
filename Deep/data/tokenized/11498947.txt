In order to investigate the effect of 7-nitroindazole (7-NI) on penicillin-induced epilepsy and the relationship between NO and anti-epileptic effect of electro-acupuncture, computerized physiological polygraph and NO-sensitive electrode with potentiostat were respectively used to record the total power spectrum (TPS) of EEG and the concentration of NO in rat hippocampus pretreated with electro-acupuncture or 7-NI for 30 min before penicillin. The results showed that the TPS of EEG and concentration of NO in hippocampus increased greatly after the epilepsy induction. Treatment with electroacupuncture inhibited the TPS of EEG sharply (P < 0.01). The latency and threshold of epilepsy induction were decreased by 7-NI, but paroxysm abated and the TPS was inhibited (P < 0.05) as compared with the control group. Both pretreatments with 7-NI and electroacupuncture decreased the NO concentration (P < 0.01). The above results suggest that the propagation of penicillin-induced seizures is facilitated by nNOS, but with some increase in the latency and threshold of induction. Electroacupunture may inhibit seizure through decreasing nNOS transcription in hippocampus.
