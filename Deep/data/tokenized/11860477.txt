It has been recently demonstrated that ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated proteolysis is required for long-term synaptic facilitation in Aplysia. Here we show that the hippocampal blockade of this proteolytic pathway is also required for the formation of long-term memory in the rat. Bilateral infusion of lactacystin, a specific proteasome inhibitor, to the CA1 region caused full retrograde amnesia for a one-trial inhibitory avoidance learning when given 1, 4 or 7h, but not 10 h, after training. Proteasome inhibitor I produced similar effects. In addition, inhibitory avoidance training resulted in an increased ubiquitination and 26S proteasome proteolytic activity and a decrease in the levels of IkappaB, a substrate of the ubiquitin-proteasome cascade, in hippocampus 4 h after training. Together, these findings indicate that the ubiquitin-proteasome cascade is crucial for the establishment of LTM in the behaving animal.
