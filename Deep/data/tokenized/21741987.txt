Activation of adenosine receptors modifies the action of classic neurotransmitters (i.e. dopamine, glutamate and acetylcholine) and other neuromodulators, like vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and neuropeptide S (NPS). Similarly to adenosine, NPS is involved in the regulation of stimulus and response to fear and arousal. Thus, the present study investigates the effects of NPS on locomotor activity in mice treated with or without alpha,beta-methylene adenosine 5'-diphosphate (AOPCP), the inhibitor of ecto-5'-nucleotidase. Additionally, we evaluate the activity of ecto-5'-nucleotidase in brain slices of mice treated with or without NPS. Male adult CF-1 mice received i.c.v. NPS as 0.1 nmol injection with or without pre-treatment with 1 nmol alpha,beta-methylene adenosine 5'-diphosphate (AOPCP), the selective inhibitor of ecto-5'-nucleotidase, to evaluate locomotor activity. In another set of experiments, mice received i.c.v. infusion of 0.1 nmol NPS to assay enzymatic activity in brain slices. The results demonstrated that the pre-treatment with AOPCP, which was inactive per se, prevented NPS-induced hyperlocomotion in mice. The dose of 0.1 nmol NPS was efficient to induce hyperlocomotion in animals during the observation period in the activity cage. Regarding enzymatic activity, i.c.v. NPS injection did not induce any significant alterations in ATP and AMP hydrolysis in striatum and hippocampus brain slices of mice. The present study shows that the hyperlocomotor effect of NPS depends on the ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity.
