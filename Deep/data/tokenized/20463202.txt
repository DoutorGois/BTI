Analysis of local field potentials (LFPs) helps understand the function of the converging neuronal populations that produce the mixed synaptic activity in principal cells. Recently, using independent component analysis (ICA), we resolved ongoing hippocampal activity into several major contributions of stratified LFP-generators. Here, using pathway-specific LFP reconstruction, we isolated LFP-generators that describe the activity of Schaffer-CA1 and Perforant-Dentate excitatory inputs in the anesthetized rat. First, we applied ICA and current source density analysis to LFPs evoked by electrical subthreshold stimulation of the pathways. The results showed that pathway specific activity is selectively captured by individual components or LFP-generators. Each generator matches the known distribution of axonal terminal fields in the hippocampus and recovers the specific time course of their activation. Second, we use sparse weak electrical stimulation to prime ongoing LFPs with activity of a known origin. Decomposition of ongoing LFPs yields a few significant LFP-generators with distinct spatiotemporal characteristics for the Schaffer and Perforant inputs. Both pathways convey an irregular temporal pattern in bouts of population activity of varying amplitude. Importantly, the contribution of Schaffer and Perforant inputs to the power of raw LFPs in the hippocampus is minor (7 and 5%, respectively). The results support the hypothesis on a sparse population code used by excitatory populations in the entorhino-hippocampal system, and they validate the separation of LFP-generators as a powerful tool to explore the computational function of neuronal circuits in real time.
