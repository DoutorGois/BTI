UNLABELLED: Protein kinase M zeta (PKMzeta), an atypical isoform of protein kinase C, has been suggested to be necessary and sufficient for the maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term memory (LTM). This evidence is heavily based on the use of zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP), a supposed specific inhibitor of PKMzeta that interferes with both LTP and LTM. Problematically, both LTP and LTM are unaffected in both constitutive and conditional PKMzeta knock-out mice, yet both are still impaired by ZIP application, suggesting a nonspecific mechanism of action. Because translational interference can disrupt neural activity, we assessed network activity after a unilateral intrahippocampal infusion of ZIP in anesthetized rats. ZIP profoundly reduced spontaneous hippocampal local field potentials, comparable in magnitude to infusions of lidocaine, but with a slower onset and longer duration. Our results highlight a serious confound in interpreting the behavioral effects of ZIP. We suggest that future molecular approaches in neuroscience consider the intervening level of cellular and systems neurophysiology before claiming influences on behavior. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Long-term memory in the brain is thought to arise from a sustained molecular process that can maintain changes in synaptic plasticity. A so-called candidate for the title of "the memory molecule" is protein kinase M zeta (PKMzeta), mainly because its inhibition by zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP) interferes with previously established synaptic plasticity and memory. We show that brain applications of ZIP that can impair memory actually profoundly suppress spontaneous brain activity directly or can cause abnormal seizure activity. We suggest that normal brain activity occurring after learning may be a more primary element of memory permanence.
