In humans, the administration of phencyclidine causes schizophrenic-like symptoms that persist for several weeks after withdrawal from phencyclidine use. We demonstrated here that mice pretreated with phencyclidine (10 mg/kg/day s.c. for 14 days) showed an enduring impairment of associative in a Pavlovian fear conditioning 8 days after cessation of phencyclidine treatment. Extracellular signaling-regulated kinase (ERK) was transiently activated in the amygdalae and hippocampi of saline-treated mice after conditioning. In the phencyclidine-treated mice, the basal level of ERK activation was elevated in the hippocampus, whereas the activation was impaired in the amygdala and hippocampus after conditioning. Exogenous N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), glycine, and spermidine-induced ERK activation was not observed in slices of hippocampus and amygdala prepared from phencyclidine-treated mice. Repeated olanzapine (3 mg/kg/day p.o. for 7 days), but not haloperidol (1 mg/kg/day p.o. for 7 days), treatment reversed the impairment of associative learning and of fear conditioning-induced ERK activation in repeated phencyclidine-treated mice. Our findings suggest an involvement of abnormal ERK signaling via NMDA receptors in repeated phencyclidine treatment-induced cognitive dysfunction. Furthermore, our phencyclidine-treated mice would be a useful model for studying the effect of antipsychotics on cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia.
