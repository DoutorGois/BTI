Increasing evidences implicate impairment of axonal integrity in mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative disorders. Beta-boswellic acid (BBA) is the major component of Boswellia serrata gum. This resin has long been used in Ayurveda (India's traditional medicine) to prevent amnesia. In this study, the effect of BBA was examined on neurites outgrowth and branching as well as on polymerization dynamics of tubulin. The morphometric parameters (axonal length and neuritis branching) were examined microscopically after treating the hippocampal cells with BBA. Also the assembly process of tubulin was assessed using UV/V is spectrophotometer through following of absorbance at 350 nm. The results revealed that BBA could significantly enhance neurite outgrowth, branching, and tubulin polymerization dynamics. The obtained results suggest that enhancing effect of BBA on microtubule polymerization kinetics might be the origin of increasing axonal outgrowth and branching.
