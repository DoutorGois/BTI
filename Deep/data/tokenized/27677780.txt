The structure and utilization of memory is central to one's knowledge of the past, interpretation of the present, and prediction of the future. Therefore, the understanding of the structural and process components of memory systems at the psychological and neurobiological level is of paramount importance. There have been a number of attempts to divide learning and memory into multiple memory systems. Schacter and Tulving, Memory systems 1994. MIT Press, Cambridge (1994) have suggested that one needs to define memory systems in terms of the kind of information to be represented, the processes associated with the operation of each system, and the neurobiological substrates, including neural structures and mechanisms, that subserve each system. Furthermore, it is likely that within each system there are multiple forms or subsystems associated with each memory system and there are likely to be multiple processes that define the operation of each system. Finally, there are probably multiple neural structures that form the overall substrate of a memory system.
