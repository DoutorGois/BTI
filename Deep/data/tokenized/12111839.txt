To identify the roles of pyridoxine-5'-phosphate (PNP) oxidase in epileptogenesis and the recovery mechanisms in spontaneous seizure, a chronological and comparative analysis of PNP oxidase expression was conducted. PNP oxidase immunoreactivity in a preseizure group of seizure-sensitive (SS) gerbils was detected more strongly than that in a seizure-resistant (SR) group. The density of PNP oxidase immunoreactivity in a 30 min postictal group was significantly lower than that in a preseizure group. In a 12 hr postictal group, PNP oxidase immunodensity had recovered to a preseizure level. The overexpression of PNP oxidase in the hippocampus of preseizure SS gerbils suggests that PNP or pyridoxal 5'-phosphate plays an important role in the modulation of glutamic acid decarboxylase activity and gamma-aminobutyric acid reuptake as mediated by membrane transporter via neurons. In addition, this change in the PNP oxidase immunoreactivity following seizure may be a compensatory response designed to reduce epileptic activity in this animal.
