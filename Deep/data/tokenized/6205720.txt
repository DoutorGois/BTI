Rat hippocampal slices were incubated with [3H]uridine in vitro to analyze the metabolism of nuclear RNA and the RNA precursor fractions. Labeling of total nuclear RNA was linear for 4 h of incubation and proportional to the concentration of labeled uridine in the incubation medium. Addition of 3.5 X 10(-8) M corticosterone to the incubation medium produced an enhancement of nuclear RNA labeling with no significant effect on the labeling of the RNA precursor fraction. Progesterone and dexamethasone, at the same concentration, had no effect on either variable. Labeling of RNA by cerebellar slices under the same conditions was approximately one-half the value obtained using hippocampal slices and the cerebellar RNA precursor fraction accumulated only 65% of the radioactivity from [3H]uridine found in the hippocampal pool. Corticosterone had no effect on the labeling of total nuclear RNA in cerebellar slices. Nuclear poly(A)-containing RNA constituted 19% of the total labeled nuclear RNA in these incubations, as estimated by oligo (dT)-cellulose chromatography. Cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine) at a concentration of 25 micrograms/ml inhibited to some extent the labeling of total nuclear RNA and the RNA precursor fraction, but preferentially diminished the amount of labeled RNA bound to oligo (dT)-cellulose. Corticosterone increased the amount of [3H]RNA which bound to oligo (dT)-cellulose, while progesterone had no effect. These results show that hippocampal slices maintained in vitro, can be used to analyze nuclear RNA metabolism, one positive regulator of which in the rat hippocampus is the adrenal steroid, corticosterone.
