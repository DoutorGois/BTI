Chronic stress and corresponding chronic elevations of glucocorticoid hormones have been widely assumed to have deleterious effects on brain anatomy and functions such as learning and memory. In particular, it has been suggested that chronic elevations of glucocorticoid hormones result in death of hippocampal neurons and in reduced rates of hippocampal neurogenesis. It is not clear, however, if any increase in glucocorticoid levels has negative effects on hippocampal anatomy as many animals regularly maintain moderately elevated levels of glucocrticoids over long periods of time under natural energetically demanding conditions. We used unbiased stereological methods to investigate whether mountain chickadees (Poecile gambeli) implanted for 49 days with continuous time-release corticosterone pellets, designed to approximately double the baseline corticosterone levels, differed from placebo-implanted chickadees in their hippocampal anatomy and cell proliferation rates. We found no significant differences between corticosterone and placebo-implanted birds in either telencephalon volume, volume of the hippocampal formation, or the total number of hippocampal neurons. Cell proliferation rates, measured as the total number of BrdU-labeled cells in the ventricular zone adjacent either to the hippocampus or to the mesopallium, were also not significantly different between corticosterone and placebo-implanted chickadees. Our results suggest that prolonged moderate elevation of corticosterone might not provide the suggested deleterious effects on hippocampal anatomy and neurogenesis in food-caching birds and, as we have shown previously, it actually enhances spatial memory.
