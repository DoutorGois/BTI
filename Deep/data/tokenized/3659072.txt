The effect of cognition-enhancing agents oxiracetam and aniracetam on scopolamine-induced amnesia and brain acetylcholine decrease was investigated in the rat. Acetylcholine levels were measured by means of a gas-chromatographic method. Scopolamine (0.63 mg/kg IP 60 min before training) prevented the acquisition of a passive avoidance conditioned response ("step through": retest 30 min after training) and brought about a 64, 56 and 42% decrease in acetylcholine level in the cortex, hippocampus and striatum respectively. Oxiracetam (50 and 100 mg/kg IP) administered 30 min before scopolamine reduced the scopolamine-induced amnesic effect and decrease in acetylcholine level in the cortex and hippocampus, but not in the striatum. Lower and higher doses of oxiracetam were ineffective. Aniracetam (100 mg/kg PO) also prevented scopolamine-induced amnesia but attenuated acetylcholine decrease in the hippocampus only. Aniracetam (300 mg PO) reduced acetylcholine decrease in the hippocampus but did not prevent scopolamine-amnesia. In conclusion, oxiracetam and aniracetam exert a stimulatory effect on specific central cholinergic pathways. However, a direct relationship between cognition-enhancing properties and cholinergic activation needs further confirmation.
