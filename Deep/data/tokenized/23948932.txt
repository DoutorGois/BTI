Alterations in hippocampal neurogenesis have been recognized as an integral part of Alzheimer's disease. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic factors; one of them is diet. This review provides an assessment of the current state of the field in hippocampal neurogenesis studies in Alzheimer's disease and focuses on the role of diet. The review highlights some of the key dietary compounds and interventions such as calorie restriction, fat, polyphenols, zinc, folate, alcohol and thiamine, and emphasizes the pathways that they modify.
