We showed previously that electrographic seizures involving dentate granule cells in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures were dramatically reduced following chronic treatment with the NR2B-selective antagonist, Ro25,6981, but were increased following chronic treatment with the high-affinity competitive antagonist, D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (D-APV). To begin to investigate the potential mechanisms underlying the differential effects of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists on seizures, electrophysiologic experiments were conducted in dentate granule cells in hippocampal slice cultures treated for the entire 17-21 day culture period with vehicle, Ro25,6981 or D-APV. Initial experiments revealed a lack of an association between miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) measures and seizures suggesting that shifts in mEPSC were unlikely to account for the differential effects of D-APV and Ro25,6981 on seizures. However, the amplitude of tonic NMDAR-mediated currents was reduced in cultures treated chronically with D-APV and dramatically enhanced in cultures treated chronically with Ro25,6981. Because tonic NMDAR currents are mediated primarily by extrasynaptic NMDAR, these data show an inverse relationship between changes in extrasynaptic NMDAR function and alterations in seizure expression.
