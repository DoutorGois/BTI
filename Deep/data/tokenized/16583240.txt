In the present study, we sought to determine whether chronic treatment with perazine alters lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) levels in the following rat brain regions: the hypothalamus, frontal cortex, striatum and hippocampus. Male Wistar rats were administered perazine dimaleate (15 or 30 mg/kg/day) in drinking water for 21 days. On day 22, LPS was injected i.p. (125 microg/kg) 2 h before decapitation. Concentrations of perazine and its metabolites in plasma and brain was assessed by HPLC. The levels of IL-1 beta were determined using ELISA. Treatment with perazine (30 mg/kg/day) reduced LPS-stimulated IL-1 beta levels in the hypothalamus, and a tendency to its decrease in the striatum and frontal cortex was observed. This in vivo study suggests for the first time that long-term oral administration of perazine modulates reactivity of cells producing IL-1 beta.
