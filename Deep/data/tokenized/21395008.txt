Experiments in vitro showed that dimeric linear substituted dipeptide GK-2-a new mimetic of the nerve growth factor (NGF) - introduced in a concentration of 10(-5) M and 10(-8) M in the culture of immortalized murine hippocampal cell line HT-22 increases the synthesis of heat shock proteins HSP32 and HSP70 (neuroprotectors belonging to the endogenous system of cell protection) and stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkA receptor, which is specific for neurotrophins.
