Examined are changes in the acid mucopolysacharides contents (AMPS) in the brain of rat after I. P. application of 2 X 10(6) iu/kg of Na benzyl penicillin inducing epileptic-convulsive phenomenon with grand mal. Decreased AMPS were found in all examined cerebral regions except in cerebellum. Statistically highly significant decrease was found in hippocampus, hypothalamus and septum (p less than 0.001). Intensive cerebral metabolism during convulsions is considered to be a cause of decreased AMPS. Changes were marked in hippocampus due to its common vulnerability in relation to epileptic discharge.
