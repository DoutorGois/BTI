The elicitation of repeated focal seizures (kindling) induces mossy fiber sprouting in the hippocampus of the rat. The present study investigated whether repeated generalized seizures also induce mossy fiber sprouting. Human psychiatric patients receive repeated generalized seizures during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Male Long-Evans rats received a course of eight electroconvulsive shock (ECS) seizures administered on a 48-h schedule over a course of 2 1/2 weeks. Control subjects received matched handling, but no stimulation. Fourteen days after the last ECS trial, all subjects were sacrificed and their brains subjected to Timm staining. Cell counts and area measures were also taken in the hilus. Significant sprouting, but not significant cell loss, was seen in the fascia dentata of the subjects that had received ECS.
