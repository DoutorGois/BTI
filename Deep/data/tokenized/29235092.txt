BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Administration of bumetanide has anxiolytic effects in rat models of conditioned fear. As a loop diuretic, bumetanide may act as an anxiolytic by modulating GABAergic synaptic transmission through the antagonism of cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs). Its clinical potential for the treatment of anxiety disorders deserves further investigation. In this study, we evaluated the possible role of the basolateral nucleus of amygdala (BLA) in the anxiolytic effect of bumetanide. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Brain slices extracellular recording, stereotaxic surgery, fear-potentiated startle, locomotor activity monitoring and western blotting were applied in this study. KEY RESULTS: Systemic administration of bumetanide (15.2 mg/kg, IV) 30 min prior to fear conditioning significantly inhibited the acquisition of fear-potentiated startle (FPS). The phosphorylation of ERK in BLA was reduced after bumetanide administration. In addition, suprafusion of bumetanide (5 or 10 muM) attenuated amygdaloid long-term potentiation (LTP) in a dose-dependent manner. Intra-amygdala infusion of bumetanide 15 min prior to fear conditioning also blocked the acquisition of FPS. Finally, the possible off-target effect of bumetanide on conditioned fear was excluded by side by side control experiments. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These results suggest BLA plays a critical role in bumetanide's anxiolytic effect.
