The monoamines noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA), adrenaline (AD) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) were assayed in the putamen (PUT), the lateral (lCAU) and medial (mCAU) portions of the caudate, the dorsal (dHIP) and ventral (vHIP) hippocampus, as well as in four cortical areas, i.e., anterior cingulate (CIN), entorhinal-piriform (EnPi), sensorimotor (SSC; somatosensory) and primary visual (VIS). The use of an HPLC procedure enabled us to perform these measurements in microdissected samples and to assay as well monoamine metabolites. The DA levels were highest in the neostriatum, moderate in the EnPi and CIN and very low in the SSC, VIS and hippocampus. The distribution of NA was more uniform, although higher concentrations were measured in the neostriatum, hippocampus and EnPi. The largest amounts of 5-HT were in the EnPi, while moderate concentrations were found in the other regions. The ratios between the neurotransmitters and their metabolites were used as an index of turnover and indicate that the terminal fields of the monoamine systems are heterogenous within the neostriatal, hippocampal and cortical subdivisions.
