We studied conduction velocity in peripheral nerves and the block of synaptic transmission produced by lack of glucose in hippocampal slices from 4- and 12-month-old streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and their age-matched controls. In sural nerves of young and old diabetic rats, the conduction velocity was reduced by 30-35%. In slices from young diabetics, CA1 synaptic transmission was more sensitive to aglycemia than in control slices. However, all slices from older rats showed comparable increases in CA1 synaptic sensitivity to aglycemia. We conclude that the cerebral adaptation to diabetic hyperglycemia apparent in the hippocampus of young rats is masked in older rats by an age-dependent increase in sensitivity to lack of glucose.
