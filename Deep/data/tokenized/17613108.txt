Animal tissues are exposed to sulfite used as a preservative in food and drugs, and generated from the catabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids. Sulfite, which is a very reactive and potentially toxic molecule, is detoxified by the enzyme sulfite oxidase (SOX). Laboratory animals can be made deficient in SOX by the administration of a high-tungsten/low molybdenum regimen. It has been suggested that SOX deficient rats might be used as a model for the prediction of sulfite toxicity in humans. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ingested sulfite on hippocampus superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities in SOX competent and deficient rats. Hippocampus SOD, CAT and GPx activities were found to be significantly increased by sulfite treatment in SOX competent groups. On the other hand, exposure to sulfite had no effect on antioxidant status in hippocampus of SOX deficient rats. In conclusion, these results suggest that hippocampus antioxidant capacity where defense mechanism against the oxidative challenge is up regulated by sulfite in SOX competent rats. This up regulation mechanism in antioxidant enzymes against to sulfite related oxidative stress is not observed in SOX deficient rats and remains to be explained.
