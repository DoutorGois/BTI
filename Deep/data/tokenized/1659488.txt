The present article reviews studies from our laboratory, which have shown that excitatory amino acids receptors of the N-methyl-D-aspartate type are involved in the induction of long-term potentiation in the Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway of rat hippocampal slices. The nature of the excitatory amino acid receptors that mediate the response that is modified by the induction of long-term potentiation is also considered. The mechanism of induction of long-term potentiation is discussed, as are some possible stages that are required for the maintenance of this process. Some new data are presented concerning the ability of N-methyl-D-aspartate to potentiate synaptic transmission and to depress the amplitude of the presynaptic fibre volley. Concerning the potentiation, it is shown that brief (1-2 min) perfusion of slices with N-methyl-D-aspartate is sufficient to potentiate synaptic transmission for at least 3 h. The N-methyl-D-aspartate induced depression of the presynaptic fibre volley is shown to be transient and independent of synaptic transmission.
