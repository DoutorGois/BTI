The medial septal nuclei are essential for the naturally occurring hippocampal theta rhythm. Evidence that the rhythmic activity of the septum is carried via cholinergic afferents to the hippocampus has been: (a) the existence of a cholinergic septo-hippocampal projection, and (b) the sensitivity of one type of theta rhythm to antimuscarinic agents or cholinergic depletion. The muscarinic action of acetylcholine on pyramidal cells, however, is too slow to carry even a 4 Hz signal. Recent in vitro studies have confirmed a fast excitatory response by some hippocampal interneurons to muscarinic agonists. In urethane anesthetized rats, iontophoretic application of atropine to 17 hippocampal theta cells (presumed interneurons) during the theta rhythm, reduced their firing rates to an average of 24% of control rates. The effect of iontophoretic atropine application to 4 CA1 complex-spike cells (presumed pyramidal cells) was a selective elimination of their bursting activity with no significant effect on overall firing rate. The data suggest that: (1) interneuronal firing, during the hippocampal theta rhythm, is dominated by an excitatory cholinergic input and not by excitatory collaterals of pyramidal cells; and (2) somatic burst firing by CA1 pyramidal cells requires the presence of acetylcholine.
