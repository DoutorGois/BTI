Lesion studies have demonstrated that frequency memory, or memory for the frequency of occurrence, is associated with prefrontal and not temporal lobe lesions. This study examined neural activation during performance on a frequency-memory-judgment task and a recognition-memory task, both using words. Relative to a control task, the authors observed peaks of activation during frequency-memory performance in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 45) and other areas typically associated with working memory (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex). Recognition performance was associated with activation in the same left ventrolateral prefrontal location as was observed with frequency memory. When comparing activation during frequency memory with activation during recognition memory, the authors found a suppression of activation in the hippocampus bilaterally during frequency memory. This study supports a neuroanatomical distinction between frequency and recognition memory.
