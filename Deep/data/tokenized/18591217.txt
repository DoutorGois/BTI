Repeated exposure to cocaine results in neuroadaptations that can alter the way the brain responds to subsequent stimuli. Earlier studies demonstrated that acute administration of cocaine up-regulates the immediate-early gene fos-related antigen 2 (fra-2) followed by a later up-regulation of sigma(1) receptor gene and protein levels in brain regions involved in addiction and reward. To test whether such alterations could have long-term consequences on behavior, the present study was undertaken. Using a cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization model coupled with gene and protein expression studies in mice, the results show that cocaine induces the expression of fra-2, which leads to a progressive increase in sigma(1) receptor gene and protein expression over a period of days. This progressive increase in sigma(1) expression corresponds to the steady increase in the locomotor response to repeated cocaine administration in mice. The cocaine-induced changes in fra-2 and sigma(1) receptor gene and protein expression occur in brain regions that subserve drug abuse, such as the cortex, striatum, and hippocampus, but not the cerebellum. Moreover, the prototypic sigma(1) receptor antagonist 1-[2-(3,4-dichloropheny)ethyl]-4-methylpiperazine (BD1063) significantly attenuates both the molecular adaptations and behavioral sensitization induced by cocaine. These data suggest that repeated exposure to cocaine elicits alterations in fra-2 and sigma(1) receptor-mediated mechanisms, which ultimately manifest as altered behavioral responses to cocaine.
