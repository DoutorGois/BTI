To characterize receptor subtypes in the mouse, we performed autoradiographic localization and pharmacological characterization studies using the selective radiolabeled agonists, [(125)I]-Leu(31), Pro(34)-PYY and [(125)I]-PYY 3-36. The pharmacology of [(125)I]-Leu(31), Pro(34)-PYY and [(125)I]-PYY 3-36 binding to mouse brain homogenates were consistent with Y1-like and Y2-like receptors, respectively. Using receptor autoradiography, high Y1-like binding was observed in the islands of Calleja and dentate gyrus. [(125)I]-PYY 3-36 binding was highest in the hippocampus, lateral septum, stria terminalis of the thalamus, and compacta and lateralis of the substantia nigra. In addition, there are differences in receptor distribution in mouse brain compared to other species that may translate into different functional roles for the NPY receptors within each species.
