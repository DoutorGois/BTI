In order to examine hippocampal plasticity following spatial learning, expression of the gamma isoform of protein kinase C (PKCgamma) was analyzed in mice, following experience and training on the Barnes spatial maze. Both context-exposed (animals familiarized with the maze but not trained) and trained animals (animals trained to escape the maze using spatial cues) showed increased immunoreactivity to PKCgamma in the CA1 region in comparison to naive, home-caged animals. However, there were no quantitative differences in PKCgamma immunoreactivity between context-exposed and trained animals. These changes suggest that spatial experience and training result in altered activation of PKCgamma, consistent with the idea that PKCgamma activation in the CA1 region participates in postsynaptic plasticity associated with spatial experiences and learning.
