The present study was undertaken to evaluate innervation and possible growth promotion by posterior hypothalamic tissue on different areas that are, or are not, interactive with this brain region during development. Posterolateral hypothalamus was dissected from embryonic day 17 rat fetuses, and inserted into the anterior chamber of the eye of adult rat hosts. Two weeks postgrafting, a second transplant consisting of either fetal hippocampal, cerebellar, or lung tissue was placed adjacent to the first graft. Growth of the intraocular double transplants was monitored weekly by measurements through the cornea. Fetal hippocampal tissue grew significantly larger when placed together with a hypothalamic graft, as compared to single hippocampal transplants. Cerebellar or lung tissue growth was not stimulated by a hypothalamic cograft. Pyramidal neuron cell counts demonstrated a significantly higher final number of these neurons in growth-stimulated hippocampal grafts, as compared to non-stimulated single hippocampal grafts. Immunohistochemistry with antibodies directed against histamine or histidine decarboxylase revealed that hippocampal transplants received the most dense histaminergic innervation. Cerebellar transplants contained occasional histaminergic neurites, and lung tissue never exhibited any histaminergic innervation from the adjacent hypothalamic graft. Taken together, these results demonstrate a growth-promoting effect of posterior hypothalamic tissue on developing hippocampal tissue, as well as target specificity of histaminergic innervation patterns.
