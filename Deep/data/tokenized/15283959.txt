Medial septal neurons innervate the entire hippocampal formation. This input provides a potent regulation of hippocampal formation physiology (e.g. theta) and memory function. Medial septal neurons are rich in cholinergic receptors and thus are potential targets for the development of cognitive enhancers. Direct intraseptal infusion of cholinomimetics alters hippocampal physiology and can produce either promnestic or amnestic effects. Several variables (e.g. age of animal, integrity of septohippocampal circuits, task difficulty) may influence treatment outcome. We have previously demonstrated that intraseptal carbachol (12.5-125 ng) infusion immediately after the sample session of a delayed-non-match-to-sample radial maze paradigm produces a dose-dependent amnesia. The present study examined whether manipulating the timing of intraseptal carbachol infusion with respect to the sample session would alter the amnestic effect. A within-subjects design was used to examine the effect of intraseptal carbachol (125 ng/0.5 microl) in a delayed-non-match to sample radial maze task. During a sample session, rats retrieved rewards from six of 12 maze arms. At the test session (3 h later), only the alternate set contained reward and entries into the sample set arms constituted errors. Intraseptal carbachol was administered: 1) 30 min prior; 2) immediately prior; 3) immediately after and 4) 90 min after the sample session. Intraseptal carbachol prior to the sample had no effect on any index of accuracy. Infusion immediately after the sample, or delayed 90 min into the retention interval, produced an acute amnesia. These findings demonstrate that the timing of treatment is a critical variable in determining the memory effects of septohippocampal manipulations and that dynamic changes in cholinergic tone are important for memory.
