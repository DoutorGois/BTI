Neuritogenesis, or neurite outgrowth, is a critical process for neuronal differentiation and maturation in which growth cones are formed from highly dynamic actin structures. Gas7 (growth arrest-specific gene 7), a new member of the PCH (Pombe Cdc15 homology) protein family, is predominantly expressed in neurons and is required for the maturation of primary cultured Purkinje neurons as well as the neuron-like differentiation of PC12 cells upon nerve growth factor stimulation. We report that Gas7 co-localizes and physically interacts with N-WASP, a key regulator of Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin polymerization, in the cortical region of Gas7-transfected Neuro-2a cells and growth cones of hippocampal neurons. The interaction between Gas7 and N-WASP is mediated by WW-Pro domains, which is unique in the PCH protein family, where most interactions are of the SH3-Pro kind. The interaction contributes to the formation of membrane protrusions and processes by recruiting the Arp2/3 complex in a Cdc42-independent manner. Importantly, specific interaction between Gas7 and N-WASP is required for regular neurite outgrowth of hippocampal neurons. The data demonstrate an essential role of Gas7 through its interaction with N-WASP during neuronal maturation/differentiation.
