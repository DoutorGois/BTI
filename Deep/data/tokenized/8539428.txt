1. The differential role played by blockade of D-1 or D-2 dopamine receptors in mechanisms underlying seizures was studied in a model of EEG after-discharge induced by electrical stimulation of selective brain regions (dorsal hippocampus and amygdala) in the rabbit. 2. The D-2 antagonist haloperidol (1 mg/Kg) increased significantly after-discharge duration after stimulation of either hippocampus or amygdala and lowered after-discharge threshold in few animals. 3. The D-1 antagonist SCH 23390 (0.3 mg/Kg) caused no changes following stimulation of amygdala and reduced after-discharge duration when hippocampus was stimulated. 4. Haloperidol exerted a proconvulsant action in this experimental model, having a clearer influence on D-2 receptors. SCH 23390 had no effect on amygdala whereas it exerted protection on the hippocampus. 5. The present data suggest that D-1 and D-2 receptors have different roles in generating and spreading the epileptic activity.
