The hippocampus is generally believed to be only rarely affected in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. In a systematic study of the hippocampus in 6 cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the stratum moleculare-lacunosum showed a definite spongiform change with gliosis in 5 cases. The stratum radiatum et pyramidale showed spongiform change in 3 of the 5 cases. The subiculum, presubiculum, parasubiculum and entorhinal cortex were involved in all the cases. These results suggest that involvement of the hippocampus may not be uncommon in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The stratum moleculare-lacunosum seems to be the site preferentially affected. This pathology may contribute to progression of dementia in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
