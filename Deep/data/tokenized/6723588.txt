When forebrain-bisected photosensitive baboons, Papio papio, were kindled from the amygdala or hippocampus, bilateralization of convulsive seizure proved difficult, and the final stage of bisymmetrical and bisynchronous convulsive seizure unique to this species did not develop despite more than twice the number of kindling stimulations required for its development in nonbisected baboons. At the secondary site amygdala, convulsive seizure development was suppressed. Findings of the present and previous studies suggest that the corpus callosum plays: (a) a major, if not an exclusive, role in convulsive seizure bilateralization ; and (b) a critical role in the development of primarily generalized convulsive seizures unique to this epileptic baboon. Finally, in the absence of the corpus callosum (and the hippocampal commissure) the transhemisphere seizures suppressing effect generated by amygdaloid kindling appears to be mediated through the subcortical pathway which presumably exists in the brainstem.
