1. The quantal mechanism underlying the expression of long-term potentiation (LTP) was studied in the mossy-fiber (mf) synapses of the rat hippocampus. Whole-cell recordings were used to measure the excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) before and after LTP induction in brain slices maintained at 31 +/- 1 degrees C. 2. Evoked EPSCs were recorded from 473 CA3 pyramidal neurons. The mf synapses were stimulated using paired pulses (40-ms interpulse interval) repeated every 2-10 s. At least 400 pairs of mf responses were obtained before and during the expression of LTP, which was produced by high-frequency (100 Hz) mf stimulation. Sufficiently stationary data were obtained from five neurons that exhibited LTP and that also satisfied strict criteria and procedures that are necessary for eliciting and identifying unitary mf responses. 3. Three independent lines of evidence implicated a presynaptic component to the mechanism underlying mf LTP. The first was based on a graphical version of the classical method of variance. The graphical variance (GV) method was evaluated by clamping the cell at two different holding potentials during paired-pulse facilitation (PPF). The results indicated that the GV method can distinguish changes in mean quantal content m and mean quantal size q in rat mf synapses. The same analysis, when applied to PPF before and after LTP induction, indicated that both result from an increase in m. 4. The second line of evidence was based on the classical method of failures. Consistent with the inference that mf LTP is due to an increase in m, there was a statistically significant reduction in the number of quantal release failures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
