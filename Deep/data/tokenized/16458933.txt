Previous studies demonstrated that Tiaoxin Recipe (TXR), a traditional Chinese medicinal prescription, could alleviate cognitive dysfunction. NT-1, an active constituent isolated from this prescription under guidance of bioactive evaluation, was preliminarily proved to enhance the ability of spatial learning and memory in rats. In the present study, using hippocampal slice preparations, we investigated the mechanisms by which NT-1 improves cognitive dysfunction contributed to corticosterone (CORT). NT-1 ameliorated the inhibition of LTP by CORT more significantly than TXR did. These results suggested that enhancing LTP induction is one mechanism by which NT-1 improves spatial learning and memory impaired by CORT.
