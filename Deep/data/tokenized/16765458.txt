Hypoxia-ischemia (HI) is associated with premature birth, and injury during term birth. Many infants experiencing HI later show disruptions of language, with research suggesting that rapid auditory processing (RAP) deficits (i.e., impairment in the ability to discriminate rapidly changing acoustic signals), play a causal role in language problems. We recently bridged these lines of research by showing RAP deficits in rats with unilateral-HI injury induced on postnatal days 1, 7, or 10 (P1, P7, or P10. While robust RAP deficits were found in HI animals, it was suggested that our within-age sample size did not provide sufficient power to detect age-at-injury differences within the pooled HI group. The current study sought to examine differences in neuropathology and behavior following unilateral-HI injury on P1 versus P7 in rats. Ages chosen for HI induction reflect differential stages of neurodevelopmental maturity, and subsequent regional differences in vulnerability to reduced blood flow/oxygen (modeling age-related differences in premature/term HI injury). Results showed that during the juvenile period, both P1 and P7 HI groups exhibited significant RAP deficits, but deficits in the P1 HI group resolved with repeated testing (compared to shams), while P7 HI animals showed lasting deficits in RAP and spatial learning/memory through adulthood. The current findings are in accord with evidence that HI injury during different stages of developmental maturity (age-at-injury) leads to differential neuropathologies, and provide the novel observation that in rats, P1 versus P7 induced pathologies are associated with different patterns of auditory processing and learning/memory deficits across the lifespan.
