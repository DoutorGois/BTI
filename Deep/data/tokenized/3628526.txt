The effects of selective partial lesions of the Fimbria-Fornix (FiFx) on reversal and place learning sets were investigated in rats by using a T-maze and a semi-circular multiple discrimination apparatus. Lesions restricted to the Fimbria (Fi) produced a significant deficit in reversal and place learning set, whereas lesions to the Fornix (Fx) only disturbed the learning set based on a reversal procedure. Combined Fi + Fx lesions resulted in impairment in the retention of spatial discrimination tested in the two mazes. Ventral Hippocampal Commissure (vhc) had no significant effect on reversal learning set. These results confirm previous data that the hippocampal formation is involved in learning transfer, and suggest that the Fi and the Fx may play a role in learning set. Our data also confirm previous demonstrations of the ability of rats to rapidly acquire place learning set.
