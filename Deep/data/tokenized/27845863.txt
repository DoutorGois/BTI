Sargassum serratifolium was found to contain high concentrations of meroterpenoids, having strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective activities. This study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of an ethanolic extract of S. serratifolium (ESS) using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2 microglial cells and to identify the anti-inflammatory components in ESS. The level of proinflammatory cytokines was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression of inflammation-related proteins and mRNA was evaluated by Western blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis, respectively. Anti-inflammatory activities of isolated components from ESS were analyzed in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells. ESS inhibited LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 and the expression of inducible NO synthase and cyclooxygenase-2. ESS also decreased the release of proinflammatory cytokines in a dose-dependent manner. LPS-induced nuclear factor-kappa B (kappaB) transcriptional activity and translocation into the nucleus were remarkably suppressed by ESS through the prevention of inhibitor kappaB-alpha degradation. The main anti-inflammatory components in ESS were identified as sargahydroquinoic acid, sargachromenol, and sargaquinoic acid based on the inhibition of NO production using LPS-stimulated BV2 cells. Furthermore, treatment with ESS significantly reduced levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta stimulated with LPS in mouse hippocampus. Our results indicate that ESS can be used as a functional food or therapeutic agent for the treatment of neuroinflammatory diseases.
