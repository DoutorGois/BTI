Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is characterized by intrusive recall of the traumatic memory. While numerous studies have investigated the neural processing mechanisms engaged during trauma memory recall in PTSD, these analyses have only focused on group-level contrasts that reveal little about the predictive validity of the identified brain regions. By contrast, a multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) approach towards identifying the neural mechanisms engaged during trauma memory recall would entail testing whether a multivariate set of brain regions is reliably predictive of (i.e., discriminates) whether an individual is engaging in trauma or non-trauma memory recall. Here, we use a MVPA approach to test 1) whether trauma memory vs neutral memory recall can be predicted reliably using a multivariate set of brain regions among women with PTSD related to assaultive violence exposure (N=16), 2) the methodological parameters (e.g., spatial smoothing, number of memory recall repetitions, etc.) that optimize classification accuracy and reproducibility of the feature weight spatial maps, and 3) the correspondence between brain regions that discriminate trauma memory recall and the brain regions predicted by neurocircuitry models of PTSD. Cross-validation classification accuracy was significantly above chance for all methodological permutations tested; mean accuracy across participants was 76% for the methodological parameters selected as optimal for both efficiency and accuracy. Classification accuracy was significantly better for a voxel-wise approach relative to voxels within restricted regions-of-interest (ROIs); classification accuracy did not differ when using PTSD-related ROIs compared to randomly generated ROIs. ROI-based analyses suggested the reliable involvement of the left hippocampus in discriminating memory recall across participants and that the contribution of the left amygdala to the decision function was dependent upon PTSD symptom severity. These results have methodological implications for real-time fMRI neurofeedback of the trauma memory in PTSD and conceptual implications for neurocircuitry models of PTSD that attempt to explain core neural processing mechanisms mediating PTSD.
