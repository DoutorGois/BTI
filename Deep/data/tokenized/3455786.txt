These studies were undertaken to determine whether estrogen receptors and the microsomal enzyme system called the aromatase complex, which is responsible for conversion of androgen to estrogen, are present in the brain of the rhesus monkey during perinatal life. Four monkeys (three females--one fetus removed on day 153 of gestation and two infants, 5 and 6 days postnatal--and 1 male, 2 days postnatal) were studied. Cytosol estrogen receptors were detected in all brain regions examined. The apparent equilibrium dissociations constants for reaction of these sites with [3H]moxestrol were similar to those for uterine and pituitary cytosol estrogen receptors (0.3-1.1 nM). Within the brain, highest levels of binding were observed in the hypothalamus-preoptic area, with fairly even, lower concentrations throughout the cortical structures. Aromatase complex activity was detected in the majority of the tissue specimens. The highest levels of estrogen formation were observed in the hypothalamus. However, the amygdala, the hippocampus, and several of the cortex samples also contained measurable aromatase complex activity. Among the cortical samples, the highest levels of aromatase complex activity were found in regions of the association cortex (the dorsolateral-prefrontal, orbital-prefrontal, anterior cingulate, and parietal cortices). The lowest levels of aromatase activity were found in the somatosensory and motor cortices of the postnatal animals. These results suggest that locally-formed estrogen may be involved in the effects of circulating androgens on the developing primate neocortex.
