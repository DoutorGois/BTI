The effect of repeated electroconvulsive shocks (ECS) on the responsiveness to isoprenaline of an endogenous, specific inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (type I inhibitor) was tested in rat hippocampus and brainstem. Isoprenaline produced a dose-dependent decrease in the type I inhibitor activity in these brain structures. Neither the basal activity nor the isoprenaline-induced changes of type I inhibitor activity were affected by a single ECS. However, a series of 11 ECS markedly reduced the response of the type I inhibitor activity to isoprenaline. The action of isoprenaline was completely blocked by propranolol and markedly enhanced by aminophylline. The results indicate that the subsensitivity of beta-adrenoceptors is accompanied by reduced responsiveness of type I inhibitor activity to isoprenaline.
