The effects of pentylenetetrazol-kindling on synaptic transmission and the effectiveness of &theta; pattern primed-bursts (PBs) for the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) of population excitatory postsynaptic potentials and population spikes were investigated in hippocampal CA1 of pentylenetetrazol-kindled rats. Experiments were carried out in the control and kindled animals at two post-kindling periods, i.e., 48-144 h (early phase) and 30-33 days (long lasting phase). Field potentials (population excitatory postsynaptic potentials, pEPSPs; and population spikes, PSs) were recorded at the stratum radiatum and the stratum pyramidale following stimulation of the stratum fibers, respectively. PBs were delivered to stratum fibers and PB potentiation was assessed. The results showed that 48-144 h after kindling there was no significant difference for pEPSP slope and PS amplitude between two groups. But at 30-33 days after kindling, the pEPSP slope in the stratum radiatum of kindled animals decreased, whereas the amplitude of PSs increased compared to those of controls. Shortly after kindling, control animals had normal LTP of pEPSP slope and PS amplitude in response to PBs, but kindled rats lack LTP of pEPSP slope and PBs induced LTP of PS amplitude in most of kindled animals. In 30-33 days after kindling, PB potentiation was not observed in the stratum radiatum of kindled animals but PBs induced LTP of PS amplitude, which was significantly greater than that of control animals. The effect is compatible with the hypothesis, which postulates kindling-associated functional deficit in hippocampus, especially CA1, as an explanation for the behavioral deficits seen with the kindling model of epilepsy.
