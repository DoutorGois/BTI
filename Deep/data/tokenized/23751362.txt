Glucocorticoids are given to pregnant women at risk for premature delivery to promote lung maturation. Despite reports of detrimental effects of glucocorticoids on telencephalic neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs), the regional and cellular expressions of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in various NSPC populations in the intact brain have not been thoroughly assessed. Therefore in this study we performed a detailed analysis of GR protein expression in the developing mouse ventral and dorsal telencephalon in vivo. At embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5), the majority of Pax6-positive radial glial cells (RGCs) and Tbr2-positive intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs) expressed nuclear GR, while a small number of RGCs on the apical ventricular zone (aVZ), expressed cytoplasmic GR. However, on E13.5, the latter population of RGCs increased in size, whereas abventricular NSPCs and especially neurons of the cortical plate, expressed nuclear GR. In IPCs, GR was always nuclear. A similar expression profile was observed throughout the ventral telencephalon, hippocampus and olfactory bulb, with NSPCs of the aVZ primarily expressing cytoplasmic GR, while abventricular NSPCs and mature cells primarily expressed nuclear GR. Close to birth, nuclear GR accumulated within specific cortical areas such as layer V, the subplate and CA1 area of the hippocampus. In summary, our data show that GR protein is present in early NSPCs of the dorsal and ventral telencephalon at E11.5 and primarily occupies the nucleus. Moreover, our study suggests that the subcellular localization of the receptor may be subjected to region and neurodevelopmental stage-specific regulation.
