We investigated changes in levels of GABAA receptor alpha4 subunit mRNA in the mouse brain after administration of volatile or i.v. anesthetic, by performing quantitative RT-PCR. We also performed immunohistochemical assays for c-fos-like protein. During deep anesthesia (which was estimated by loss of righting reflex) after administration of propofol, levels of GABAA receptor alpha4 subunit mRNA in the hippocampus, striatum and diencephalons were significantly greater than those observed after administration of pentobarbital, midazolam or GOI (5.0% isoflurane and 70% nitrous oxide in oxygen). Under incomplete anesthesia, levels of GABAA receptor alpha4 subunit mRNA were significantly increased by midazolam in all brain regions, and were significantly increased by pentobarbital in the posterior cortex and striatum. Expression of GABAA receptor alpha4 subunit mRNA closely correlated with expression of c-fos-like protein. These results indicate that the GABAA receptor alpha4 subunit plays an important role in regulating the anesthetic stage of i.v. anesthetics.
