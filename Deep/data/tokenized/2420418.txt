A simple dip method of Timm staining was developed. Because perfusion with sulphides and/or aldehydes is not required for adequate staining, the method can be employed with more control on human tissue taken at autopsy. Timm-stained human hippocampus reveals silver deposition in the mossy fiber region with a distribution similar to that in rats, but with some variation in the extent of penetration into stratum pyramidale. Adjacent cryostat sections of rat brain can be reacted for glyoxylic acid induced fluorescence by using the SPG dip method.
