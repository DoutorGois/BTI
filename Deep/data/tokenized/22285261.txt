NB-2/contactin-5 plays an important role in synapse formation in the developing auditory system of rodents. In this study, to further elucidate the molecular role of NB-2 in synapse formation, we examined the interaction between NB-2 and amyloid precursor-like protein 1 (APLP1), as well as their possible co-localization at the synapse. Pull-down assays and cell surface binding assays demonstrated that NB-2 interacts with APLP1. Furthermore, the protein expression profile of APLP1 in western blots was similar to that of NB-2, and localization of APLP1 mRNA partially overlapped that of NB-2 mRNA. In cultured hippocampal neurons, immunofluorescence signals for both NB-2 and APLP1 overlapped with synapsin, a presynaptic marker. Biochemical analysis showed that both NB-2 and APLP1 were enriched in the presynaptic fraction. These results indicate that NB-2 forms a cis-complex with APLP1 on the presynaptic membrane.
