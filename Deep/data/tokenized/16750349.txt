Although several brain morphologic studies have suggested abnormalities in the temporal regions to be a common indicator of vulnerability for the schizophrenia spectrum, less attention has been paid to temporal lobe structures other than the superior temporal gyrus or the medial temporal region. In this study, we investigated the volume of gray matter in the fusiform gyrus, the parahippocampal gyrus, the middle temporal gyrus, and the inferior temporal gyrus using magnetic resonance imaging in 39 schizotypal disorder patients, 65 schizophrenia patients, and 72 age and gender matched healthy control subjects. The anterior fusiform gyrus was significantly smaller in the schizophrenia patients than the control subjects but not in the schizotypal disorder patients, while the volume reduction of the posterior fusiform gyrus was common to both disorders. Volumes for the middle and inferior temporal gyri or the parahippocampal gyrus did not differ between groups. These findings suggest that abnormalities in the posterior region of the fusiform gyrus are, as have been suggested for the superior temporal gyrus or the amygdala/hippocampus, prominent among the temporal lobe structures as a common morphologic substrate for the schizophrenia spectrum, whereas more widespread alterations involving the anterior region might be associated with the development of full-blown schizophrenia.
