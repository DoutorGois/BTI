In search of factors influencing the outcome of an ischemic insult, we induced 10 min of forebrain ischemia in rats and assessed neuronal necrosis by quantitative histopathology after 1 week of recovery. Procedures for inducing ischemia included bilateral carotid artery clamping and reduction of blood pressure to 40-50 mm Hg by bleeding. To facilitate rapid lowering of blood pressure, a ganglionic blocker, trimethaphan (TMP), was administered at the onset of ischemia. Omission of the ganglionic blocker proved to markedly ameliorate neuronal damage. Similarly favorable effects were obtained when a mixture of adrenaline and noradrenaline (1 microgram kg-1 min-1 each) was infused during the early recirculation period in animals previously given TMP. Infusion of noradrenaline alone also ameliorated the damage, though the efficacy was somewhat less. The results suggest that catecholamines, released as a response to stress, ameliorate ischemic brain damage.
