Epilepsy affects 50 million people worldwide and about 30% of these patients will not be adequately controlled with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) alone. For patients where resective surgery is not indicated, deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be an effective alternative. The majority of available literature targets the thalamic nuclei (anterior; centromedian), subthalamic nucleus, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Here, we review patient outcomes and adverse events related to DBS to these various targets. Data show DBS may be a safe and effective treatment option for refractory epilepsy.
