1. The mechanisms underlying the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the medial and lateral perforant paths were studied by recording excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) from rat dentate granule cells in vitro using extracellular and whole-cell recording techniques. 2. Paired stimuli (interstimulus interval, 50-1,000 ms) resulted in facilitation of the lateral and depression of the medial perforant path-evoked EPSPs, respectively. This physiological difference was used to isolate responses evoked by stimulation of a single path. 3. Tetanic stimulation induced LTP in both pathways, although the magnitude of LTP in the lateral perforant path was significantly less than that in the medial perforant path. Both forms of LTP were blocked by the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (D-APV). 4. Buffering intracellular calcium by loading granule cells with the calcium chelator bis (O-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid prevented LTP in both pathways. 5. Pairing of low-frequency (0.25 Hz) afferent stimulation with postsynaptic depolarization induced LTP in the medial but not the lateral perforant path. However, pairing of higher-frequency stimulation (1-4 Hz) with postsynaptic depolarization did potentiate the lateral perforant path-evoked EPSP in some cells. 6. Both the medial and lateral perforant path-evoked EPSPs had two components; a fast component blocked by the non-NMDA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione and a slower, voltage-dependent component blocked by D-APV. 7. The results indicate that the induction of LTP in both the medial and lateral perforant paths requires activation of postsynaptic NMDA receptors and a rise in intracellular calcium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
