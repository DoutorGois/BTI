Nicotinic acetylcholine (nAChR) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) play critical roles in memory function. This study administered chronic nicotine to determine the alterations of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 2A and 2B (NR2A, NR2B) and the alterations of alpha7nAChR receptor. It was determined that the effectivity of nicotine and the data support that nicotine increases hippocampal NR2A and B expression. Additionally, the role of nicotine in the cognitive improvement was not supported by the antioxidative mechanisms or the authors observed no effect of nicotine on lipid peroxidation at the hippocampus.
