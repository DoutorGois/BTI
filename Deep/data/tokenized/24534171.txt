Spatial learning is a model of higher human cognitive functions which is used for studying animal behavior. Histaminergic and noradrenergic systems play a modulatory role in learning and memory. The present study aimed to test the effects of alpha-adrenoceptor agonist/antagonist microinjection into the CA1 region of dorsal hippocampus on histamine-induced spatial learning facilitation in the water maze task. Pre-training intra-CA1 microinjection of alpha1- or alpha2-adrenergic agonist, phenylephrine (0.0025mug/rat) or clonidine (0.05mug/rat) decreased traveled distance and escape latency at the start of the training phase, suggesting a spatial learning facilitation; while the higher dose of the drugs (phenylephrine 0.005mug/rat, clonidine 0.2 and 0.5mug/rat) increased the performance level at the end of the training phase, indicating a water maze spatial acquisition impairment. However, alpha1-receptor antagonist, prazosin (1mug/rat) impaired spatial learning; alpha2-receptor antagonist, yohimbine (0.25mug/rat) facilitated spatial acquisition. Moreover, pre-training intra-CA1 microinjection of a subthreshold dose of phenylephrine (0.001mug/rat) reversed histamine response, while ineffective dose co-administration of clonidine (0.1mug/rat) potentiated histamine (0.01mug/rat) response. Subthreshold dose of prazosin or yohimbine did not alter histamine response. Bilateral infusion of histamine (0.05mug/rat) facilitated spatial learning by itself. Furthermore, the drug's injections had no effect on swimming speed on the training days of MWM. These results suggest that alpha-adrenergic receptors of the dorsal hippocampal CA1 regions may play an important role in histamine-induced facilitation of spatial acquisition.
