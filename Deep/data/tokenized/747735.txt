The determination of choline and acetylcholine by field desorption mass spectrometry from rat brain tissue samples has been demonstrated. Essential points of the assay are the use of stable isotope labelled internal standards, a simple ion pair extraction procedure, direct analysis of the quaternary ammonium ions without derivatization, and accumulation of the electrically recorded field desorption ion signals with a multi-channel analyser. The analysis of sample amounts in the picogram range gave quantitative data of good precision (0.6--10% standard deviation).
