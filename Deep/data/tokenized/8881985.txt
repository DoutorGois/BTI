Neuronal expression of the ALZ-50 epitope was investigated in hippocampus and medulla from infants dying of sudden infant death syndrome or known causes (controls). Hippocampal studies include data from 31 infants dying of known causes between 32 weeks' gestation and 16 months postpartum and 46 infants who died of sudden infant death syndrome. The medulla at the level of the mid olivary protuberance was investigated in 22 infants with sudden infant death syndrome and 11 controls matched for age and postmortem interval. Medullary sections were also examined using immunohistochemical methods to demonstrate reactivity to glial fibrillary acidic protein antibody. The density of ALZ-50-immunodecorated neurons in control hippocampus rises from the level observable in utero to a maximum between 1 and 4 months of age and declines thereafter. The density of ALZ-50-immunoreactive neurons in hippocampus is significantly increased in infants with sudden infant death syndrome at all ages. Significant regionally specific increases in the number of ALZ-50-immunoreactive neurons, and glial fibrillary acidic protein-reactive cells were found in sudden infant death syndrome medulla; coincidental increases were observed in only the solitary nucleus. Neurons exhibiting the ALZ-50 epitope may reflect apoptotic neuron death of normal development, and increased numbers of immunoreactive neurons may suggest enhanced neurodegeneration in sudden infant death syndrome.
