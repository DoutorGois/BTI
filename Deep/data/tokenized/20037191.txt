The present study was undertaken in order to investigate the effects of static magnetic field (SMF) exposure on the antioxidative enzymes activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration and DNA oxidation in male rat brain. The exposure of rats to SMF (128 mT, 1 h/day during 30 consecutive days) decreased the glutathione peroxidase (GPx; -39%, p < 0.05), CuZn superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD; -35%, p < 0.05) and catalase (-59%, p < 0.05) activities in frontal cortex. The same treatment decreased the CuZn-SOD (-51%, p < 0.05) and Mn-SOD (-13%, p < 0.05) activities in hippocampus. However, the glutathione levels remained unchanged in the both brain structures. In the hippocampus, SMF exposure increased MDA concentration (+32%, p < 0.05). Interestingly, exposed-rats to SMF displayed a significant increase of metallothioneins level in frontal cortex (+100%, p < 0.05), while the 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodGuo) concentration remained unaffected, indicating the absence of DNA oxidation. Our results indicated that sub-chronic exposure to SMF induced oxidative stress in rat hippocampus and frontal cortex. Metallothionein induction protected probably DNA against oxidative damage.
