We investigated the effects of treatment with trimethyltin (TMT) on the expression of glutathione-related enzymes in mouse hippocampus. TMT promoted the expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST) Ya/Yc mRNA, and GSTA2 protein, but not that of glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit mRNA, 1 day after injection. TMT produced a slight but significant elevation of GST activity during the period from day 1 to 7 post-treatment. No significant change was seen in the activity of glutathione peroxidase at anytime post-TMT treatment. Our data suggest the prolonged elevation of GST activity in the hippocampus following TMT treatment through enhanced expression of the GST Ya/Yc.
