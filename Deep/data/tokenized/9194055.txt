The effects of the muscarinic receptor blocker atropine on associative long-term potentiation were studied in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus. Focal excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSP) were recorded in living slices. Local application of atropine (0.1 mM) significantly inhibited associative long-term potentiation (40-60 min after tetanization) in the "weak" input (str. radiatum 128 +/- 10% compared with 168 +/- 9% in controls). Long-term potentiation at the "strong" input (str. oriens) was increased relative to the control (from 137 +/- 13% to 158 +/- 4%). These results indicate that endogenous acetylcholine aids the development of long-term potentiation in synapses with low levels of activation.
