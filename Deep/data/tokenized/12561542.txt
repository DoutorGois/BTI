In order to determine the level of mouse zinc transporter3 (ZnT3) mRNA expression, the fragment is cloned by RT-PCR method and is sequenced by dideoxynucleotide method. The expression of ZnT3 mRNA is also examined by RT-PCR method and is compared with beta-actin that served as the control. As the result, a proper single fragment of 700 bp is obtained with the sequence conformable to the corresponding fragment sequence of reported mouse ZnT3 cDNA. The ZnT3 mRNA is detected in cerebrum, hippocampus and in testis in that the highest expression is observed. However, the expression of ZnT3 mRNA is not detected in heart, liver, lung, spleen, kidney, intestine, olfactory bulb and cerebellum. The expression of ZnT3 mRNA in brain and testis suggests a physiologically functional importance of ZnT3 in mental and reproductive activities of mouse.
