Experiments were carried out on female rabbits with electrodes implanted chronically into the midbrain, dorsal hippocampus and the cerebral cortex. Physiological impedance of the brain stem, i.e. the lowest energy of trains of electric impulses stimulating the midbrain modulated through a feedback by the hippocampal theta rhythm and maintaining EEG arousal pattern, served as a measure of excitability of the brain stem reticular formation. After ovariectomy performed in 12 female rabbits, a rise in the brain stem physiological impedance was observed in relation to control measurements -- by 84.8%, on the average. In 8 ovariectomized female rabbits the physiological impedance decreased by 47.4% after subcutaneous implantation of oestradiol benzoate tablets. After removal of the implanted tablets the impedance increased by a mean value of 100.1% in all the female rabbits.
