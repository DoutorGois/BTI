Studies on the distribution of ATP in microdissected segments of the rat brain indicate that the nucleotide is concentrated in gray matter, and especially in the thalamus, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and sensorimotor cortex. These distribution studies in conjunction with previous neuropharmacological studies, support the concept that adenine nucleotides may function as intercellular mediators in various regions of the brain.
