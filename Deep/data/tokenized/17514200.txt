It is now widely accepted that neurogenesis occurs in two regions of the adult mammalian brain--the hippocampus and the olfactory bulb. There is evidence for adult neurogenesis in several additional areas, including the neocortex, striatum, amygdala and substantia nigra, but this has been difficult to replicate consistently other than in the damaged brain. The discrepancies may be due to variations in the sensitivity of the methods used to detect new neurons.
