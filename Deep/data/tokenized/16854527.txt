The role of the hippocampus in novel object recognition (NOR) memory remains controversial. Here we report the finding that the dorsal hippocampus is essential for consolidation of NOR memory up to 3h after training. Temporary inactivation of the dorsal hippocampus with a bilateral intrahippocampal infusion of muscimol immediately or 3h, but not 6h post-training impaired 24-h NOR retention in male rats. These results strongly indicate that the dorsal hippocampus is required for early and delayed NOR consolidation.
