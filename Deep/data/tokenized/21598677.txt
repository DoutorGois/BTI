We studied the influence of stimulation of the CA1 and CA3 areas of the hippocampus on the impulse activity of respiratory neurons (RN) of the medulla oblongata under normal and oxygen deficiency conditions. Under conditions of normal atmospheric pressure, the electrical stimulation of the CA1 and CA3 areas of the hippocampus had mainly an inhibiting influence. In the initial phase, at a 4-5-thousand meter altitude, activation of frequent discharge of neurons occurred. In this situation, stimulation of the CA1 and CA3 areas was more accentuated than under conditions of normoxia. In the second phase (an altitude of 7.5-8 thousand meters), on the reduction of the impulse activity of neurons, stimulation of the CA1 and CA3 areas of the hippocampus induced untypical responses of these neurons.
