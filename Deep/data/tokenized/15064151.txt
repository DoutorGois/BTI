The activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) has been implicated in the pathological changes accompanying inflammatory and apoptotic processes of various cell types including neurons. In a kainic acid (KA)-induced mouse seizure model, p38 MAPK is induced in reactive astrocytes in the CA3 region of the hippocampus where severe neuronal loss occurs. Here we report the delayed and protracted activation of p38 MAPK in the CA3 region of the hippocampus of mice treated with KA. In this model, the inhibition of p38 MAPK isoforms by SB203580, a specific inhibitor, attenuated neuronal loss in the CA3 and CA1 regions of the hippocampus, which was accompanied by the suppression of the p38 MAPK activation as well as astrogliosis. Thus, the delayed and sustained induction of p38 MAPK plays a crucial role in the neuronal damage of KA-induced brain seizures.
