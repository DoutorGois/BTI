The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of nano-CuO on voltage-gated sodium current (I(Na) ) in hippocampal CA1 neurons. The results suggested that nano-CuO inhibited amplitudes of I(Na) currents and prolonged peak rise time of action potential (AP). The responses to nano-CuO were inhibited by reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger. However, the G-proteins inhibitor did not block the effects of nano-CuO. The effects of nano-CuO were mediated through activation of ROS-I(Na) -AP signaling cascades and independent from G-proteins pathway.
