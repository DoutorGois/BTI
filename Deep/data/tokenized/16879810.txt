Antimitotic drugs used in the chemotherapeutic treatment of cancers induce undesirable but unavoidable side-effects from interruption of normal mitotic processes throughout the body. We have examined whether several such drugs capable of penetrating the blood-brain barrier - thioTEPA and 5-fluorouracil - influence the normal process of cell proliferation underlying neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus of mice. thioTEPA was found to yield a pronounced dose-related inhibition in cell proliferation, while 5-fluorouracil did not. The magnitude of the inhibition paired with a lack of observable impairment of health in mice indicates a suitable experimental model for elucidating the contributions of hippocampal cell proliferation to cognition and behavior.
