Survival, quantitative morphology of the hippocampus, cerebral tissue impedance and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were studied in the Mongolian gerbil after 15 minutes of bilateral common carotid occlusion. A subgroup of animals was placed in cages with free access to running-wheels for two weeks preceding ischaemia to measure voluntary locomotor activity. Survival was enhanced in the running-wheel subgroup, with 90% of the animals still alive after 14 days as compared to 48% of the non-running group. Neuronal loss was found in all animals in the hippocampus (CA1, CA2, CA3 and CA4), and was most pronounced in the CA1 sector. In the running-wheel group, however, neuronal loss was significantly lower in sectors CA2, CA3 and CA4. The increases of cerebral impedance, which indicate ischaemic cell swelling, reached 190% in both groups during ischaemia. During postischaemic recirculation, however, impedance normalized more rapidly in the running-wheel group, indicating earlier resolution of ischaemic cell swelling. In wheel-running gerbils, postischaemic hyperperfusion evolved earlier and was more pronounced as compared to non-runners. No differences in systemic blood pressure were observed during cerebral ischaemia or thereafter.
