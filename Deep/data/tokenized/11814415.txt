The hippocampal theta rhythm (theta) was reported to be associated with movements, attention, auditory processing, autonomic functions, learning and memory and postulated as an associator of discontiguous events. Since visual information includes temporal cues, our study was centered on the correlation between hippocampal theta rhythm and lateral geniculate activity. Phase relationships between hippocampal theta and unit firing were found with both spontaneous and light evoked activity during wakefulness, slow wave and paradoxical sleep. This temporal correlation was dynamic, exhibiting changes related to the sleep-waking cycle and perhaps to attention shifts. Hippocampal theta rhythm may supply a low frequency temporal dimension to the processing of visual information.
