alpha 1-Antichymotrypsin (ACT) and beta-amyloid have been reported to be present in senile plaques. We investigated the combination effects of ACT and a novel synthetic beta-amyloid peptide, on rat primary cultured brain neurons. ACT had no effect in high density culture and decreased the number of surviving neurons in low density cell culture. Combination of ACT with beta 25-40 did not affect the toxicity of beta 25-40 in high and low density culture.
