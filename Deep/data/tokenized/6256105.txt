1. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) was measured in homogenates of regions of rat brain using the substrate Hip-His-Leu. 2. The enzyme resembles classical ACE in its marked Cl- dependence and inhibition by both SQ 20,881 (24 micro mol/1) and EDTA (1 mmol/1). 3. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto controls (NT-WK) were killed at 20-22 weeks of age their brains dissected into eight regions. 4. There were marked region variations of ACE with highest levels in striatum, hippocampus, cerebellum and pituitary and lower levels in hypothalamus and cerebral cortex. 5. In three brain regions ACE was significantly lower in SHR compared to NT-WK: medulla oblongata (P < 0.05), hypothalamus (P < 0.02) and cerebral cortex (P < 0.05). In the other sites the levels were not different. 6. These region-specific differences of ACE in the SHR could lead to altered production or metabolism of central neuropeptides postulated to be involved in the control of blood pressure.
