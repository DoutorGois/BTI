Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) has been reported to promote the formation of axonal branches in cultured brain neurons. In the present study, we investigated whether the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade was involved in this action of bFGF in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Recombinant human bFGF (0.1-10 ng/ml) induced phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK in a concentration and time-dependent manner. The phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK occurred rapidly within 5 min after addition of bFGF, and lasted for 48 h. The bFGF-induced phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK and axonal branch formation were both blocked by simultaneous addition of U0126 and PD98059, specific inhibitors of MAPK kinases. Furthermore, when U0126 and PD98059 were added 24 h after bFGF, phosphorylation of p44/42 m MAPK was decreased, and axonal branch formation was stopped. These results suggest that sustained activation of the MAPK cascade is required for bFGF-mediated axonal branch formation.
