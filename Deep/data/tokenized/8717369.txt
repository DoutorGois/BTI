We cloned genes the expression of which is induced in the Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) hippocampus after transient forebrain ischemia by a differential display technique. Among these genes, a rat serine protease inhibitor SPI-3 homologue was isolated. Present analyses suggested that the expression of gerbil SPI-3 mRNA was closely associated with delayed neuronal death and may block activities of proteases leaking from degenerating neurons or may support neuronal survival.
