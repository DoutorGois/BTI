The effects of acute lead exposure on extracellularly recorded evoked responses in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices were investigated. Field potentials in response to paired-pulse stimulation were assessed while perfusing the slices with normal media and media containing lead in concentrations of 0.2 microM to 53 microM. The evoked population excitatory postsynaptic potentials decreased during lead exposure to a lesser extent than the orthodromically evoked population spike, whereas the presynaptic fiber volley remained unchanged. The maximal inhibition of the orthodromically evoked responses depended strongly on the lead concentration. The input-output relations of the orthodromic responses obtained during perfusion with lead significantly differed from those during control conditions. The somatic short-term potentiation obtained by paired-pulse stimulation increased during the lead exposure. Lead seemed to inhibit the evoked activities only transiently: within 20 min after lead onset, the recorded responses had reached the control level again in spite of further lead perfusion. In contrast to the orthodromically evoked responses, the antidromically evoked population spikes remained constant at all concentrations used. It is concluded from these results that lead acts presynaptically in the hippocampal slice preparation. Additionally, lead interferes with non-synaptic processes at the pyramidal neurons in the CA1. Possible influences of lead over different neurotransmitter systems are discussed.
