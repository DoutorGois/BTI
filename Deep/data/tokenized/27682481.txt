Objective: To explore the effect of BDNF pathway on lambda-cyhalothrin interfering estrogen promoting the expression of PSD95 in hippocampus neurons. Methods: HT22 cell line were used to, treating with lambda-cyhalothrin (LCT, 50 mumol/L) , 17beta-Estradiol (E2, 10 nmol/L) , LCT (50 mumol/L) +TrkB FC (20 mug/ml) , E2 (10 nmol/L) +TrkB FC (20 mug/ml) , LCT (50 mumol/L) +ICI182 780 (1 mumol/L) , E2 (10 nmol/L) + ICI182 780 (1 mumol/L) , LCT (50 mumol/L) +E2 (10 nmol/L) for 24 h. MTT kit was used to detect cell viability. Post-synaptic Density 95 protein expression was measured by western blot. ELISA assay was used to detect the level of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) of culture supernatant and cell. Results: Campared to Sham, LCT or E2 could promote the expression of PSD95 LCT+ICI could reduce the expresion of BDNF (P<0.05) , campared to LCT, LCT+TrkB FC could reduce the expression of PSD95 and LCT+ICI cound reduce the expresion of BDNF (P<0.05) , campared to E2, E2+TrkB FC could reduce the expression of PSD95 and E2+ICI could reduce the expression of BDNF (P<0.05) , campared to E2, LCT+ E2 could reduce the expression of PSD95 and BDNF (P<0.05) . Conclusion: BDNF pathway plays a key role in E2 promoting the expression of PSD95 in neural cells. Although LCT alone has a similar effect on E2. LCT could disrupt the promotion of E2 on PSD95 expression via BDNF pathway.
