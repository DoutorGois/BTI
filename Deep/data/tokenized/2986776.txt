Previously, we have presented electrophysiological evidence reaffirming the existence of a controversial hippocampal pathway. These fibers are part of the perforant pathway and terminate directly on the CA1 cells. We now report that, in the hippocampal slice preparation, tetanic stimulation of the perforant pathway produces long-term potentiation (LTP) of CA1 cell responses. LTP of population spikes varied from 150% to 500%. The results were of interest because these axons synapse at distal sites on the apical dendrite. This location is usually thought to be a difficult site to evoke action potentials.
