Histopathology and quantitative PCR (qPCR) were used to determine the tissue distribution of Neospora caninum in calves at 80 days postinfection. Our findings revealed that the most appropriate brain areas for researching N. caninum pathogenesis were the amygdala and hippocampus for qPCR and the corpus striatum and diencephalon for histopathology.
