This report describes a patient who had a first generalized tonic clonic seizure (GTCS) at the age of 18 years. The initial MRI scan was normal on visual and quantitative examination. After a further six GTCS, a second MRI scan showed reduced hippocampal volume and increased hippocampal T2 signal, which was confirmed in a third scan. Therefore, hippocampal sclerosis may be acquired in adulthood after brief GTCS.
