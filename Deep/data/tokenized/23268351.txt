The inflammatory response following traumatic brain injury (TBI) contributes to neuronal death with poor outcome. Although anti-inflammatory strategies were beneficial in the experimental TBI, clinical translations mostly failed, probably caused by the complexity of involved cells and mediators. We recently showed in a rat model of controlled cortical impact (CCI) that leukotriene inhibitors (LIs) attenuate contusion growth and improve neuronal survival. This study focuses on spatiotemporal characteristics of macrophages and granulocytes, typically involved in inflammatory processes, and neuronal COX-2 expression. Effects of treatment with LIs (Boscari/MK-886), started prior trauma, were evaluated by quantifying CD68(+), CD43(+) and COX-2(+) cells 24h and 72 h post-CCI in the parietal cortex (PC), CA3 region, dentate gyrus (DG) and visual/auditory cortex (v/aC). Correlations were applied to identify intercellular relationships. At 24h, untreated animals showed granulocyte invasion in all regions, decreasing towards 72 h. Macrophages increased from 24h to 72 h post-CCI in PC and v/aC. COX-2(+) neurones showed no temporal changes, except of an increase in the CA3 region at 72 h. Treatment reduced granulocytes at 24h in the pericontusional zone and hippocampus, and macrophages at 72 h in the PC and v/aC. COX-2 expression remained unaffected by LIs, except of time-specific changes in the DG (increase/decrease at 24/72 h). Interrelations confirmed concomitant cellular reactions beyond the initial trauma site. In conclusion, LIs attenuated the cellular inflammatory response following CCI. Future studies have to clarify region-specific effects and explore the potential of a clinically more relevant therapeutic approach applying LIs after CCI.
