The distribution of binding sites for neuropeptide Y (NPY) was studied in the rat hippocampal region by using [3H]NPY together with quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography. The highest density of specifically bound [3H]NPY was found in regio superior and regio inferior of Ammon's horn. Within these fields, stratum oriens, stratum pyramidale and stratum radiatum harboured the highest densities of [3H]NPY binding while stratum moleculare was relatively poor in [3H]NPY binding sites. In area dentata, the highest density of [3H]NPY binding was found in the inner one third of the molecular layer. In the presubiculum and in the entorhinal area, the outer two layers were slightly more enriched in [3H]NPY binding sites than were the deep layers. In all hippocampal subfields a clear gradient of increased [3H]NPY binding was found at successively more ventral levels.
