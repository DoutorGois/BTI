Presynaptic paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) rate decreased in most CA1 pyramidal neurones following the long-term potantiation (LTP) induction. The decrease correlated with the LTP magnitude as well as with the initial (pretetanic) PPF rate. The data obtained suggests an involvement of presynaptic mechanisms in maintaining the early and the delayed LTPs.
