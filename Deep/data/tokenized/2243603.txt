The morphology of hippocampal granule cells was studied in two species of megachiropteran bats. In general the morphological appearance of megabat granule cells corresponded to that of other mammals. However, with respect to the regular presence of basal dendrites the majority of granule cells resembled their counterparts in primates, but differed from rodents and carnivores where basal dendrites are absent in adults. Due to the laminar segregation of hippocampal afferents basal dendrites are presumed to be functionally significant by receiving synaptic input from projections to the hilar region.
