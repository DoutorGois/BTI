Rhythmic spontaneous bursting is a fundamental hallmark of the immature hippocampal activity recorded in vitro. These bursts or giant depolarizing potentials (GDPs) are GABA- and glutamatergic-driven events. The mechanisms of GDPs generation are still controversial, since although a hilar origin has been suggested, GDPs were also recorded from isolated CA3 area. Here, we have investigated the origin of GDPs in hippocampal slices from newborn rabbits. Simultaneous intracellular recordings were performed in CA3, CA1 and the fascia dentata. We found a high degree of correlation between the spontaneous GDPs present in CA3 and CA1 regions. Cross-correlation analysis demonstrated that CA3 firing precedes CA1 by about 192 ms, although a significant population of discharges was recorded first in CA1 (20%). Granule cells (GCs) in the fascia dentata also showed GDPs. The frequency of these events (1.46 +/- 1.25 GDPs/min, n = 7) is significantly lower when compared with that from CA3 (3.13 +/- 1.43 GDPs/min, n = 10) or CA1 (2.94 +/- 1.36 GDPs/min, n = 17). Dual recordings from CA3 and fascia dentata cells showed synchronous bursts in both regions with no prevalent preceding area. By recording from isolated areas we found that CA1, CA3 and the fascia dentata can produce GDPs, suggesting that they emerge as a property of local circuits present throughout the hippocampus.
