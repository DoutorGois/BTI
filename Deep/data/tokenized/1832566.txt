Senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles were quantified in 14 subnuclei of the amygdala in the brains of 3 patients with Down's syndrome (DS), aged 19, 56, and 64 years, and in 1 patient with familial Alzheimer's disease (AD), aged 54 years. The amygdala of the 19-year-old Down's case contained numerous senile plaques (SPs) but no neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). The distribution of neuropathological change in the amygdala was similar among the Down's and the Alzheimer's cases. Medical and ventral regions contained more SPs and NFTs than did lateral regions, and the SPs in ventromedial subnuclei generally were the "mature" type with a prominent amyloid core. In general, the numbers of SPs and NFTs were parallel in a given subnucleus with the striking exceptions of the deep medial basal, deep cortical, and lateral central nuclei that contained far more SPs than NFTs, and the medial and lateral superficial cortical nuclei that contained numerous NFTs but few SPs. Several subnuclei strongly interconnected with hippocampus and entorhinal cortex were more heavily involved than subnuclei related to the nucleus basalis of Meynert. The patterns of SP and NFT deposition are consistent with amygdaloid abnormalities found by others in sporadic AD. These findings demonstrate the similarity in amygdaloid pathology among Down's syndrome, familial Alzheimer's disease, and sporadic AD. The presence of senile plaques in the amygdala of the 19-year-old patient with DS suggests that the amygdala is a focus of early pathological change in DS and possibly AD.
