OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of electroacupuncture on hippocampal and cortical apoptosis in a mouse model of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. METHODS: Mouse models established by repeated cerebral ischemia-reperfusion, followed by electroacupuncture at Shenshu, Geshu, and Baihui points. The control group mice were intragastrically administered Hydergine. On day 1 and 7 post-treatment, hippocampal and cortical apoptosis was detected by terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL), and apoptosis images in the hippocampal CA1 zone and cortical area were analyzed. RESULTS: In the model group, apoptotic cells were detected one day after treatment and some cellular fibers were disarrayed. By day 7 post-treatment, there was an increase in the number of apoptotic cells in the hippocampal CA1 region. In addition, there were apoptotic cells in the cortical area, the cortical layers were thinner with localized neuronal loss and sieve-like lymphocyte infiltration, as well as glial cell proliferation and visible infarct lesions. However, in the Hydergine and electroacupuncture groups, there was a small number of apoptotic cells. At 7 days post-treatment in the model group, field number, numerical density on area, and surface density were increased. However, in the Hydergine and electroacupuncture groups these parameters were decreased (P < 0.01), with a significant difference between the two treatment groups (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Electroacupuncture treatment inhibited apoptosis and provided neuroprotection.
