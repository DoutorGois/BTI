Amino acid-induced responses and their regional heterogeneities in the motor cortical and hippocampal (CA1) neurons of normal mouse and Wriggle Mouse Sagami (WMS) were studied by conventional patch-clamp techniques. There were no differences in the current densities and EC50s of glutamate-, gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA)-, and glycine-induced responses between the two groups of mice. In both types of mice, the GABA-induced current density of cortical neurones was higher and EC50 was lower than in hippocampal neurones, whereas the responses induced by glycine and glutamate did not show any differences.
