The receptor interacting protein-140 (RIP140) is a cofactor for several nuclear receptors and has been involved in the regulation of metabolic and inflammatory genes. We hypothesize that RIP140 may also affect Abeta generation because it modulates the activity of transcription factors previously implicated in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma). We found that the levels of RIP140 are reduced in Alzheimer's disease (AD) postmortem brains compared with healthy controls. In addition, in situ hybridization experiments revealed that RIP140 expression is enriched in the same brain areas involved in AD pathology, such as cortex and hippocampus. Furthermore, we provide evidence using cell lines and genetically modified mice that RIP140 is able to modulate the transcription of certain genes involved in AD pathology, such as beta-APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1) and GSK3. Consequently, we found that RIP140 overexpression reduced the generation of Abeta in a neuroblastoma cell line by decreasing the transcription of beta-APP cleaving enzyme via a PPARgamma-dependent mechanism. The results of this study therefore provide molecular insights into common signaling pathways linking metabolic disease with AD.
