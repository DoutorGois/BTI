Classical conditioning of Hermissenda, involving paired light-rotation events, results in a 30-35% decrease in the levels of a 20-kDa G protein (cp20). To test whether a similar protein exists in vertebrates, rabbits were trained to associate a tone with periorbital electrical stimulation and G proteins were analyzed by photoaffinity labeling with [alpha-32P]GTP-azidoanilide. A 20-kDa G protein similar to cp20 decreased by 36% in the hippocampus of rabbits subjected to paired tone and electrical stimulation, but not in unpaired controls. Learning-specific decreases were also found in the amount of ras protein.
