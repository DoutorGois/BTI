ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Liuwei Dihuang decoction (LW) is a typical traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescription and consists of six herbs including Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch. (family: Scrophulariaceae), Cornus officinalis Sieb. (family: Cornaceae), Dioscorea opposite Thunb. (family: Dioscoreaceae), Alisma orientale (G. Samuelsson) Juz (family: Alismataceae), Poria cocos (Schw.)Wolf (family: Polyporaceae) and Paeonia suffruticosa Andrews (family: Paeoniaceae). It has long been used clinically in treatment of many kinds of diseases with the sign of Yin insufficiency of kidney. AIM OF THE STUDY: Our previous pharmacological studies demonstrated that LW possesses effect of ameliorating the decline of the learning and memory in senescence accelerated mouse/prone 8 (SAMP8), but the mechanism has not been well established. LW-containing serum (LWCS) is used in the current study to elucidate the possible mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 6-month-old SAMP8 was used in this study to investigate the effect of LWCS on the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP). Primary cultured hippocampal neurons were used in this study to investigate the effects of LWCS on [Ca(2+)](i), I(Ca) and N-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-evoked currents. [Ca(2+)](i) was imaged using Fluo-3 and whole-cell patch recordings were applied to study the I(Ca) and NMDA-evoked currents. RESULTS: We find that LWCS facilitates the induction of LTP in hippocampal slices of 6-month-old SAMP8. In primary cultured hippocampal neurons, LWCS increases intracellular [Ca(2+)](i), the I(Ca) is suppressed by LWCS, and NMDA-evoked currents are promoted. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that LW improves the synaptic plasticity by inhibiting voltage-dependent calciumchannels (VDCCs) and promoting the function of NMDA receptors. This improvement might be one of the mechanisms contributing to cognitive improvement effect of LW.
