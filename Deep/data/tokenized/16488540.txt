A role for the pineal hormone, melatonin, in the regulation of the rhythmic expression of circadian clock genes is suggested by the finding that surgical removal of the pineal gland abolishes the rhythm of expression of clock genes such as Per1 in several neural and endocrine tissues in rodents, including the caudate-putamen (CP) and nucleus accumbens, the hypophyseal pars tuberalis and adrenal cortex. Pinealectomy has no effect on clock gene rhythms in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the master circadian clock, as well as in the eyes and heart, indicating that the effect of melatonin on clock gene rhythms is tissue specific. To further study the role of melatonin in the regulation of the rhythm of clock genes, we assessed in rats the effect of pinealectomy on the rhythm of expression of the clock protein, PER2, in a number of key limbic forebrain structures, the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST-OV), the central nucleus of the amygdala (CEA) and the hippocampus (HIPP). Despite previous evidence showing that these regions are sensitive to melatonin, pinealectomy had no effect on the daily rhythm of expression of PER2 within these structures, further supporting the view that the role of endogenous melatonin in the regulation of clock gene expression is tissue specific.
