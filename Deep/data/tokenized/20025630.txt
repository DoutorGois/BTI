Developmental iodine deficiency leads to inadequate thyroid hormone, which damages the hippocampus. In the present study, we implicate hippocampal caveolin-1 and synaptophysin in developmental iodine deficiency and hypothyroidism. Two developmental rat models were established: pregnant rats were administered either an iodine-deficient diet or propylthiouracil (PTU)-adulterated (5 p.p.m. or 15 p.p.m.) drinking water from gestational day 6 until postnatal day (PN) 28. Nissl staining and the levels of caveolin-1 and synaptophysin in several hippocampal subregions were assessed on PN14, PN21, PN28 and PN42. The results obtained show that surviving cells in the iodine-deficient and PTU-treated rats were lower than in controls. Up-regulation of caveolin-1 and down-regulation of synaptophysin were observed in the iodine-deficient and PTU-treated rats. Our findings implicate decreases in the number of surviving cells and alterations in the levels of caveolin-1 and synaptophysin in the impairments in neural development induced by developmental iodine deficiency and hypothyroidism.
