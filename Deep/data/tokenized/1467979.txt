Small cultured hippocampal neurons from rat embryos were studied with the patch-clamp technique. Single-channel currents from outside-out membrane patches were recorded under steady-state potential conditions. The most frequently found channel types were selective to K+ and showed conductances of about 30 and 80 pS in the range -20 to 0 mV. Two basic kinetic patterns were observed for the 80 pS channels. In one type, the fraction of time spent in open state increased with potential, and in the other type it decreased. For both types of 80 pS channel, the distribution of dwell times in the open state was well described by the sum of two exponentials while three exponentials sometimes were required for dwell times in the closed state. The time constants of the fitted exponentials could vary considerably during an experiment.
