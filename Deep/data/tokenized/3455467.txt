A theoretical probabilistic neural net model is proposed here based on the interaction between two subsystems, the connections of which are made up by means of chemical markers. The activity of such a system at t = n tau is exclusively dependent on the firing record of the system at t = (n-1) tau, on the level of spontaneous activity and on an external inhibitory influence which we have found that may play an important role in the prolactin release level during pseudopregnancy in rats. We explore some of the implications of this model on the possible role of the hippocampus in the phenomenon.
