The study deals with activity of three antioxidant enzymes, copper, zinc-superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), catalase (CAT) in hippocampus of rats, following the exposure to single chronic (individual housing or forced swimming) and acute (immobilization or cold) stress, as well as to combined chronic/acute stress. In addition, plasma noradrenaline (NA) and adrenaline (A) concentrations were measured in the same stress conditions, because their autooxidation can add to the oxidative stress. We observed that i) long-term social isolation and repeated forced swimming had minor effects on plasma catecholamines, but in the long-term pretreated groups, acute stressors caused profound elevation NA and A levels, ii) chronic stressors activate antioxidant enzymes, iii) acute stressors decrease catalase activity, their effects on CuZnSOD appear to be stressor-dependent, whereas MnSOD is not affected by acute stressors, and iv) pre-exposure to chronic stress affects the antioxidant-related effects of acute stressors, but this effect depends to a large extent on the type of the chronic stressor. Based on both metabolic and neuroendocrine data, long-term isolation appears to be a robust psychological stressor and to induce a "priming" effect specifically on the CuZnSOD and CAT activity.
