OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of dexamethasone on systemic lupus erythematosus complicated with cognitive dysfunction. Methods: Ten wild type mice and 20 MRL/lpr mice were applied for the research. MRL/lpr mice were randomly assigned to a MRL/lpr group and a MRL/lpr + dexamethasone (1.5 mg/kg) group. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in serum and hippocampus were detected. The protein phosphorylation levels of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (P-PI3K), protein kinase B (P-Akt), NF-kappa-B inhibitor alpha (P-IkappaBa) and nuclear transcription factor kappa-B p65 (P-NF-kappaB p65) were detected by Western blot, the level of P-NF-kappaB p65 also was detected by immunohistochemistry. Results: Treatment with dexamethasone (1.5 mg/kg) alleviated the cognitive dysfunction and decreased the levels of IL-6, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha in serum and hippocampus, and reduced the levels of P-PI3K, P-Akt, P-IkappaBa and P-NF-kappaB p65 in hippocampus in MRL/lpr mice. Conclusion: Dexamethasone may play a protective role in the cognitive function by decreasing the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in the hippocampus of MRL/lpr lupus mice.
