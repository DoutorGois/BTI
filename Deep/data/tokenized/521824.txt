A pilot study on the Yakovlev Collection in Washington, D.C. was carried out in September/October, 1977, to determine its suitability for morphometric documentation of the growth of the human brain and its structural components. The Yakovlev Collection contains complete serial sections of approximately 800 human brains which are practically unexplored with morphometric methods. The extent and quality of the Collection present a unique opportunity for enlarging into a multinational data bank for morphometric brain research.
