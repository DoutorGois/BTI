Myelination failure is associated with perinatal cerebral hypoxia-ischemia (PHI) induced brain injury in premature infants. How to efficiently promote remyelination is crucial for improving cognitive deficits caused by brain injury. Here, we demonstrated that quercetin (Que), a kind of flavonoids, significantly improved cognitive deficits and the behavior of PHI-rat in Morris water maze and open field tasks. After administration of Que to PHI-rat, the number of neogenetic Olig2(+) oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) was evidently increased in the subventricular zone. Additionally, in corpus callosum (CC), the expression of MBP (myelin basic protein) was increased, and the myelin sheaths reached normal level at 30 days with more compact while less damaged myelin sheaths and more mature oligodendrocytes (OLs) repopulating the CC compared with PHI groups. In a word, our findings indicated that Que could remarkably improve both cognition performance and myelination in the context of PHI-induced brain injury by promoting the proliferation of OPCs and strengthening survival of OLs in vivo.
