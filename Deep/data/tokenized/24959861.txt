This study was designed to investigate the protective effect of melatonin in a preclinical animal model of mania induced by ouabain (OUA). Male Wistar rats were pretreated with melatonin (5 or 20mg/kg; intraperitoneal, i.p.) for seven days or with the mood stabilizer lithium chloride (positive control) (45 mg/kg, per oral, p.o.). One day after the last dose, animals received an intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of OUA (5mul, 10(-5)M), a Na(+)K(+)ATPase-inhibiting compound. Locomotor activity was assessed in the open-field test (OFT). The levels of reactive species (RS), protein carbonyl (PC) and non-protein thiols (NPSH), as well as the activities of the superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were measured in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of rats. OUA markedly increased the locomotor activity in the OFT, and the pretreatment with melatonin or lithium chloride prevented this effect. Melatonin treatment (similar to lithium) was also effective in preventing the following alterations elicited by OUA: increase of RS and PC levels; depletion of NPSH levels; increase of SOD activity; and inhibition of CAT and GPx activities. Moreover, we found that brain oxidative stress and behavioural alterations elicited by OUA were significantly correlated. Our study showed that Melatonin, similarly to lithium, protected against OUA-induced brain oxidative stress and hyperlocomotion in rats. Thus, our findings reinforce the notion that oxidative stress may play an important role in the manic-like behavioural. Therefore, we indicate that melatonin has antimanic-like action, suggesting a potential role for this substance in the pharmacological management of Bipolar disorder.
