The present study examines changes in field excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) waveform in association with long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region of the hippocampal slice preparation. Experiments were performed in the presence of the GABAA-antagonist picrotoxin. With test field EPSP about one-third the size of that evoking spike activity (measured in the cell body layer along the same somatodendritic axis as the dendritic recording) a decreased decay time constant (approximately 8%) was seen in association with LTP. This change in field EPSP waveform was not associated with any apparent spike activity in the cell body recording. Nevertheless, several findings suggest that increased spike activity explains the change in the decay time constant of the field EPSP during LTP. First, when reducing the stimulation strength after the induction of LTP to obtain a field EPSP of the same magnitude as the pretetanus one, the change of the decay time constant was reduced to only 2.8%. Second, when using small test field EPSP (about one-fourth the size of that evoking spike activity) the decay time constant was not significantly affected in association with LTP. Third, when cutting the slice in such a manner that spike activity originating from somatic regions closer to the stimulating electrode was removed, the EPSPs decay time constant was not significantly affected in association with LTP. It is concluded that LTP is not associated with a change in the shape of the field EPSP.
