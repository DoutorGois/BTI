Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is the most toxic and well-known mycotoxin that exists in many food stuff. Exposure to AFB1 has been reported to produce serious biochemical and structural alterations in human and animal organs, however, its effect on the brain is not well studied. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate the possible histopathological effect of AFB1 and its withdrawal on the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Fifteen adult female Wistar rats were divided into 3 equal groups: control, AFB1 (15.75 mug/kg/orally, once weekly, for 8 weeks) and recovery groups. Brain sections were processed for hematoxylin and eosin staining as well as for NeuN and GFAP immunostaining. AFB1 administration resulted in several histopathological alterations including; cellular degeneration, dilatation of the blood vessels and significant decrease in the thickness of the frontal cortex and the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell layer. In the frontal cortex, there was a significant reduction in the percentage of astrocyte distribution without changes in neuronal numbers. On the other hand, in the hippocampal CA1 region, there was a significant reduction of neuronal number and a significant increase in the percentage of astrocyte distribution. Importantly, AFB1-induced structural alterations were rescued following AFB1 withdrawal. In conclusion, AFB1 induce histological alterations in the rat brain which are potentially reversible upon withdrawal.
