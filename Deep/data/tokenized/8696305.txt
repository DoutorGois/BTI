Subcutaneous injection of aFGF once per a week into senescence accelerated mice (SAM)P8 was begun at 3 weeks after birth and continued for 10 months. Saline was injected as a control. Learning and memory and cellular immunological functions in the aFGF (F) group were enhanced significantly and while those of the saline (S) group deteriorated. The number of cholinergic neurons was decreased slightly and choline acetyltransferase activity in individual neurons in the medial septum which send monosynaptic terminals to the hippocampus was significantly decreased in the S group, but were more spared in the F group. The MAO-B activity was significantly lower in the F group than in the S group. The respective densities of muscarinic and NMDA receptors and the aFGF receptor, i.e. FGFR-1 in the hippocampus were also significantly higher in the F group than in the S group. The delayed type hypersensitivity reactions (DTH) in the footpad caused by challenge with trinitrophenyl or sheep red blood cells as measured at the end of the 2nd and 7th months, indicated the T cell immune response. Both types of DTHs were reduced in the 7th month as compared with the 2nd month in the S group. However, aFGF administration protected against this reduction in response with age. These results show that aFGF provides protection against impairment of not only learning and memory but also the DTH immunoreactivity in SAMP8, indicating thereby a close relationship between learning-memory and T cell immune function.
