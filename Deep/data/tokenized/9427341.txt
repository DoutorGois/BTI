To clarify the function of HPC-1/syntaxin 1A in the mammalian central synapse, the effects of intracellularly applied antibody on the synaptic transmission were examined at the autapse of the cultured rat hippocampal neuron. Intracellularly applied antibody against HPC-1/syntaxin 1A (IgG, 0.3 mg ml(-1)) during whole-cell recording enhanced the autaptic excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC). Pre-immune IgG (0.3 mg ml(-1)) showed no effect. The amplitude-distribution of an asynchronous EPSC was not affected by administration of this antibody, indicating that the increase in the amplitude of the evoked EPSC was attributable to an increase in transmitter release from the presynaptic terminal HPC-1/syntaxin 1A could be involved in suppressing as well as facilitating process of the exocytosis at the mammalian central synapse.
