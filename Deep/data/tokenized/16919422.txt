Experiments were designed to evaluate the effects of high frequency electrical stimulation (HFS) applied in ventral hippocampus during the hippocampal kindling process, as well as on the expression of fully kindled seizures and the refractoriness for subsequent convulsions during their postictal period. Male Wistar rats, stereotactically implanted in both ventral hippocampus, received daily bilateral HFS (pulses of 60 micros width at 130 Hz at subthreshold current intensity) during 1h immediately after each kindling stimulation (1s train of 60 Hz biphasic square waves, each 1 ms) during 40 days or until the kindled state was achieved. Rats were classified as follows: (a) Responder animals, who required low current intensity for HFS (208+/-38.2 microA), did not show progress of the kindling process and remained in stages II and III seizures. (b) Nonresponders rats, in which the current intensity for HFS was higher (434.5+/-51.7 microA), developed the kindling process as the kindling control group. When HFS was applied before the kindling stimulation in fully kindled rats, animals presented a reduced expression of the fully kindled seizures (nonresponders animals) and an enhanced refractoriness for subsequent seizures during the postictal period (kindling control and nonresponder animals). There was no correlation between the area where the HFS was applied and the effects induced. It was concluded that HFS at 130 Hz in ventral hippocampus is able to modify the epileptogenesis induced by the hippocampal kindling process and the refractoriness to subsequent seizures during the postictal period in rats.
