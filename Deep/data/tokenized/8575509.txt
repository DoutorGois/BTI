alpha 2-Adrenoceptors are known to be involved in a variety of physiological functions and pathological conditions, including epilepsy and the extent of excitotoxin-induced cell death. In this study we evaluated whether selective alpha 2-adrenergic drugs can modulate the release of neurotransmitter amino acids. The effect of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist dexmedetomidine (5 micrograms/kg, s.c.) and the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist atipamezole (0.1 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg, s.c.) on the release of extracellular glutamate, aspartate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was studied with microdialysis in the hippocampus of freely moving rats under basal and K(+)-evoked conditions. Atipamezole (1 mg/kg) decreased K(+)-evoked glutamate efflux by 30% compared to the control group (P < 0.05) but did not affect significantly the effluxes of aspartate and GABA. Dexmedetomidine and the lower dose of atipamezole (0.1 mg/kg) did not significantly alter the evoked overflow of amino acids. The results suggest that alpha 2-adrenergic drugs have only modest effects on the K(+)-stimulated overflow of extracellular neurotransmitter amino acids in rat hippocampus.
