The proliferation, migration and differentiation of dentate gyrus stem and precursor cells have aroused keen interest. Neogenin and RGMb are expressed in non-overlapping compartments of the developing dentate gyrus. While Neogenin is expressed in migrating and proliferating dentate precursors, RGMb is localized in structures bordering the developing dentate, such as cornus ammonis cells and Cajal-Retzius cells in the marginal zone including the hippocampal fissure. Co-immunoprecipitation and binding assays indicate a strong physical interaction. In vitro and in vivo migration of dentate neuroepithelial cells is abolished by RGMb, and cell adhesion is reduced when cells expressing Neogenin comes into contact with cells expressing RGMb. Ectopic expression of RGMb in organotypic slice cultures and after in utero electroporation in the hippocampus modifies precursor cell migration. Our results imply that Neogenin-RGMb interaction might be involved in neuronal migration in the dentate gyrus.
