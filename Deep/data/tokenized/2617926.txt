Properties of monoamine oxidase (MAO) were investigated in mongolian gerbils brain mitochondria isolated from cerebral cortex, striatum and hippocampus during cerebral ischemia. 5 min of ischemia caused inhibition of MAO activity (kynuramine as a substrate), alterations in substrate specificity and in kinetic curves form deflexion from hyperbolic type in all the brain structures investigated. Alterations in properties of MAO were observed in hippocampus already after I min of ischemia.
