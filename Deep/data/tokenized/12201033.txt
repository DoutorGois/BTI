Spatial and temporal relations between metalloproteinase (MMP-2 and MMP-9) activation and laminin degradation in gerbil hippocampus after transient cerebral ischemia has been studied. Activity of MMPs was determined by gelatin zymography in homogenates from dorsal (DP, an equivalent of CA1 sector) and abdominal (AbP, containing CA2-4 and gyrus dentatus) parts of hippocampus. A significant activation of both investigated metalloproteinases was found at 72 h of recovery. Whereas MMP-2 up-regulation did not show any spatial preferences, the increase of MMP-9 activity was observed exclusively in DP. Activation of MMP-9 at this time point correlated spatially with degradation of laminin-protein of extracellular matrix. These results show that MMP pathway may function as a component of delayed neuronal death cascade in the apoptogenic CA1 sector after transient global ischemia.
