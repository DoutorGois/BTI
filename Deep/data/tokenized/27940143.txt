Ferulic acid is a hydroxycinnamic acid that widely presents in plant cell wall components. It has been demonstrated that ferulic acid can reverse depressive-like behaviors in both forced swimming test and tail suspension test. However, it is unclear whether chronic ferulic acid treatment can ameliorate the depressive-like behaviors in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Because of the putative relationship between neurotrophic system and antidepressant-like activity, we also investigated the effects of chronic ferulic acid on the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), postsynaptic protein PSD95, presynaptic protein synapsin I in both prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. The results showed that ferulic acid significantly alleviated CUMS-induced depressive-like behaviors in sucrose preference test and forced swimming test. In addition, ferulic acid significantly up-regulated the levels of BDNF, PSD95 and synapsin I in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. The present data indicated that ferulic acid exerted the antidepressant-like effects on behaviors by increasing neurotrophin-related synaptic protein levels in CUMS mice.
