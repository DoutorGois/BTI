The aim of our study was to present the actual views on the structure and function of the hippocampus. Recent evidence shows that internal connections within this structure do not agree with Andersen's lamellar hypothesis of hippocampal organization. The fibres course seems to prefer longitudinal flow of impulses. There are discussed functions of the hippocampus, particularly these which are involved in memory processes. We also present recent view points on the relationships between changes in hippocampal structure and Alzheimer disease.
