Sensitivity of central cerebral structures to the action of the electromagnetic fields of decimetre waves (DMW) was studied with the aid of unit activity of comissural neurons. The greatest reactivity to DMW was found in neurons of hypothalamus and hippocampus. Neurons of the midbrain RF and of the specific thalamic nuclei displayed mainly an inhibitory response. The number of neurons responding to the DMW varied depending on the energetical density.
