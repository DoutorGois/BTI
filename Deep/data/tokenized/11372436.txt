AIM: To study the improving effect of NGF (nerve growth factor) on aging-related memory impairment and its possible mechanism of action. METHODS: After direct intrahippocampal injection of NGF, the spontaneous behavior and the memory retention of aging mice were observed using open field and one-trial passive avoidance test. At the same time, the free [Ca2+] and protein synthesis in hippocampal synaptosomes were measured in vitro by using fluorescence indicator Fura-2/AM and 3H-Leu respectively. RESULTS: Compared with the control, NGF was shown to increase significantly the spontaneous behavior and explorative response in the open field, and improve remarkably the memory consolidation of old mice (P < 0.05). NGF decreased notably the intrasynaptosomal free [Ca2+] in hippocampus. Meanwhile, the incorporation of 3H-Leu into the synaptosomal proteins of hippocampus increased significantly. CONCLUSION: NGF showed an improvement effect against the aging-related memory impairment. A decrease of intrasynaptosomal free [Ca2+] and an increase in protein synthesis may be involved in this effect.
