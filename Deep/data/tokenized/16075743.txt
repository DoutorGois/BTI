OBJECTIVE: To investigate effect of inhibiting melatonin biosynthesis on activities of protein kinase A (PKA), glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) and tau phosphorylation at PS214 and M4 epitopes using haloperidol, a specific inhibitor of 5-hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase. METHODS: Brain ventricular and intraperitoneal injections were used for haloperidol administration, Western blots for tau phosphorylation, 32P-labeling for PKA and GSK-3 activity, and high performance liquid chromatograph for detection of serum melatonin levels. RESULTS: Haloperidol injection through the lateral ventricle and intraperitoneal reinforcement significantly stimulated PKA activity with a concurrent hyperphosphorylation of tau at M4 (Thr231/Ser235) and PS214 (Ser214) sites. Prior treatment of the rats using melatonin supplement for one week and reinforcement during the haloperidol administration arrested PKA activity and attenuated tau hyperphosphorylation. GSK-3 activity showed no obvious change after haloperidol injection, however, melatonin supplements and reinforcements during haloperidol infusion inactivated basal activity of GSK-3. CONCLUSION: Decreased melatonin may be involved in Alzheimer-like tau hyperphosphorylation, and overactivation of PKA may play a crucial role in this process.
