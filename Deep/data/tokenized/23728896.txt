Embolism is responsible for at least 20% of all stroke and half of cerebral infarctions. A number of animal models have been developed to mimic thromboembolic stroke. However, little aimed directly at hippocampal damage and cognitive function. In the present study, three sizes of emboli (150-178 mum, 74-124 mum, and 48-74 mum) were employed to induce thromboembolic stroke model in rats. Results showed that the diameter of the particle was critical for animal behavioral and histopathological consequences. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining revealed that CA1 and CA2-3, which are two of the main hippocampal subdivisions were injured seriously, especially induced by emboli(48-74 mum) . At 24 hr, the neurological deficit scores showed that emboli injection could cause significant neurological deficit, and the increase of neurological deficit scores correlated well to the diameter of emboli. At 60 days, emboli(150-178 mum) and emboli(48-74 mum) lead to obvious cognitive impairment, which correlated well to the hippocampal CA1 injury. Our research might be helpful to choose suitable size of emboli to induce animal model to research subcortical ischemia and vascular dementia. However, cognitive alterations and cerebral injury following different sizes of emboli injection in rats remains a topic for future investigation.
