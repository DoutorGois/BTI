Neuropathic pain and depression are very common comorbidities in diabetic patients. As the pathophysiological mechanisms are very complex and multifactorial, current treatments are only symptomatic and often worsen the glucose control. Thus, the search for more effective treatments are extremely urgent. In this way, we aimed to investigate the effect of chronic treatment with fish oil (FO), a source of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, over the mechanical allodynia and in depressive-like behaviors in streptozotocin-diabetic rats. It was observed that the diabetic (DBT) animals, when compared to normoglycemic (NGL) animals, developed a significant mechanical allodynia since the second week after diabetes induction, peaking at fourth week which is completely prevented by FO treatment (0.5, 1 or 3g/kg). Moreover, DBT animals showed an increase of immobility frequency and a decrease of swimming and climbing frequencies in modified forced swimming test (MFST) since the second week after diabetes injection, lasting up at the 4th week. FO treatment (only at a dose of 3g/kg) significantly decreased the immobility frequency and increased the swimming frequency, but did not induce significant changes in the climbing frequency in DBT rats. Moreover, it was observed that DBT animals had significantly lower levels of BDNF in both hippocampus and pre frontal cortex when compared to NGL rats, which is completely prevented by FO treatment. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that FO treatment was able to prevent the mechanical allodynia and the depressive-like behaviors in DBT rats, which seems to be related to its capacity of BDNF level restoration.
