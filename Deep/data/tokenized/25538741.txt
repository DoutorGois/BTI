Patients with concussion often present with temporary disturbance of consciousness. The microstructural and functional changes in the brain associated with concussion, as well as the relationship with transient cognitive disorders, are currently unclear. In the present study, a rabbit model of simple concussion was established. Magnetic resonance-diffusion tensor imaging results revealed that the corona radiata and midbrain exhibited significantly decreased fractional anisotropy values in the neural pathways associated with memory and the reticular formation. In addition, the apparent diffusion coefficient values were significantly increased following injury compared with those before injury. Following a 1-hour period of quiet rest, the fractional anisotropy values significantly increased, and apparent diffusion coefficient values significantly decreased, returning to normal pre-injury levels. In contrast, the fractional anisotropy values and apparent diffusion coefficient values in the corpus callosum, thalamus and hippocampus showed no statistical significant alterations following injury. These findings indicate that the neural pathways associated with memory and the reticular formation pathway exhibit reversible microstructural white matter changes when concussion occurs, and these changes are exhibited to a different extent in different regions.
