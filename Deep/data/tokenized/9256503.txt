Global long-term potentiation (LTP) was induced in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures by a brief application of 10 mM glycine. Glycine-induced LTP was occluded by previous theta burst stimulation-induced potentiation, indicating that both phenomena share similar cellular processes. Glycine-induced LTP was associated with increased [3H]alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) binding in membrane fractions as well as increased amount of a selective spectrin breakdown product generated by calpain-mediated spectrin proteolysis. Antibodies against the C-terminal (C-Ab) and N-terminal (N-Ab) domains of GluR1 subunits were used to evaluate structural changes in AMPA receptor properties resulting from glycine-induced LTP. No quantitative or qualitative changes were observed in Western blots from membrane fractions prepared from glycine-treated slices with C-Ab. In contrast, Western blots stained with N-Ab revealed the formation of a 98-kDa species of GluR1 subunits as well as an increased amount of immunoreactivity after glycine-induced LTP. The amount of spectrin breakdown product was positively correlated with the amount of the 98-kDa species of GluR1 after glycine treatment. Functional modifications of AMPA receptors were evaluated by determining changes in the effect of pressure-applied AMPA on synaptic responses before and after glycine-induced LTP. Glycine treatment produced a significant increase in AMPA receptor function after potentiation that correlated with the degree of potentiation. The results indicate that LTP induction produces calpain activation, truncation of the C-Ab domain of GluR1 subunits of AMPA receptors, and increased AMPA receptor function. They also suggest that insertion of new receptors takes place after LTP induction.
