Since ethanol and its metabolite, acetaldehyde, are directly neurotoxic, alcohol intake could affect the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) metabolizes acetaldehyde into acetate and also protects against oxidative stress, playing an important role in the development of AD. The activity of dopamine beta hydroxylase (DBH) is reduced in the hippocampus and neocortex in the AD brain. DBH is also involved in the pathophysiology of alcoholism. The aim of this study was to investigate whether polymorphisms of both ALDH2 and DBH genes were associated with AD. ALDH2*2 and two functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the DBH gene were analyzed using a case-control study design. Our case-control data set consisted of 201 AD patients and 130 age-matched controls. We also analyzed stratifying by alcohol consumption and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes. There were no associations between the SNPs studied here and the onset of AD. No synergetic associations were found among the SNPs, APOE and the risk for AD. Although high alcohol consumption AD (HAC-AD) patients were analyzed in detail, the current three SNPs were not related with HAC-AD. ALDH2*2 and functional SNPs of the DBH gene did not modify the risk for AD. Since our data set was constructed only with AD in a Japanese population, further detailed genetic analyses with other ethnic groups would be needed.
