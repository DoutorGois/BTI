Cardiac arrest (CA) is a common cause of disability and mortality and thus an important risk for human health. Circulatory failure has dramatic consequences for the brain as one of the most oxygen-consuming organs. Hippocampus, striatum and neocortex rate among the most vulnerable brain regions. The neocortex is less sensitive to hypoxia/reperfusion in comparison with the hippocampal CA1 region. That implicates the existence of efficient defense mechanisms in the neocortex against hypoxia/reperfusion injury, which we analyzed in a well-established CA rat model. We explored different immunohistochemical markers (NeuN, MAP2, GFAP, IBA1, NOX4, MnSOD, Bax, caspase 3, cfos, nNOS, eNOS, iNOS, TUNEL), amount of mitochondria, activities of respiratory chain complexes and amount/composition of cardiolipin. CA induced a moderate degeneration of cortical neurons. As possible defense mechanisms the study revealed: (i) increased activities of respiratory chain complexes of cortical mitochondria as response to increased energy demand after ACA-induced cell stress; (ii) increase of cardiolipin content as cellular stress response, which might contribute to the promotion of mitochondrial ATP synthesis; (iii) strengthening of the fast, effective and long-lasting mitochondrial MnSOD defense system; (iv) ACA-induced increase in expression of eNOS and nNOS in vasculature being able to reduce ischemic injury by vasodilation.
