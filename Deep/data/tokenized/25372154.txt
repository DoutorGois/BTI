In this report, we reasoned that non-covalent modification of amyloid beta (Abeta) by crown ethers could inhibit its aggregation. We demonstrated that PiB-C, a conjugate PiB and crown ether, could significantly reduce the aggregation in vitro. Additionally, two-photon imaging showed that PiB-C could efficiently label Abeta plaques and CAAs in AD mice.
