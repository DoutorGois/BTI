Findings have shown that histamine receptors in the hippocampus modulate the acquisition and extinction of fear motivated learning. In order to determine the role of hippocampal histaminergic receptors on recognition memory, adult male Wistar rats with indwelling infusion cannulae stereotaxically placed in the CA1 region of dorsal hippocampus were trained in an object recognition learning task involving exposure to two different stimulus objects in an enclosed environment. In the test session, one of the objects presented during training was replaced by a novel one. Recognition memory retention was assessed 24 h after training by comparing the time spent in exploration (sniffing and touching) of the known object with that of the novel one. When infused in the CA1 region immediately, 30, 120 or 360 min posttraining, the H1-receptor antagonist, pyrilamine, the H2-receptor antagonist, ranitidine, and the H3-receptor agonist, imetit, blocked long-term memory retention in a time dependent manner (30-120 min) without affecting general exploratory behavior, anxiety state or hippocampal function. Our data indicate that histaminergic system modulates consolidation of object recognition memory through H1, H2 and H3 receptors.
