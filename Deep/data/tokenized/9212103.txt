Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is widely distributed in interneurons of the central nervous system (CNS), including the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, in concentrations exceeding those of any other known neuropeptides. Sequence data comparing different species show that NPY is highly conserved. This suggests a critical role in regulation of regional neuronal excitability. Kainic acid, a glutamate agonist at kainic acid receptors, causes severe limbic motor seizures culminating in status epilepticus. We here report that NPY administered into the lateral ventricle is a powerful inhibitor of motor as well as electroencephalographic (EEG) seizures induced by kainic acid. This effect was mediated via receptors with a pharmacological profile similar to the recently cloned rat Y5 receptor. The present study is the first to demonstrate that NPY possesses anticonvulsant activity. This is consistent with the concept that NPY is an endogenous anticonvulsant and suggests that agonists acting at Y5-like receptors may constitute a novel group of drugs in antiepileptic therapy.
