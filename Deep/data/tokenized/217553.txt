The effects of electrolytic lesion of the septum on the theta activity of the dorsal hippocampus were studied in the chronically implanted Rat during wakefulness and paradoxical sleep. The experimental results show that depending on its localization, septal lesion can either: (1) eliminate the wakefulness theta rhythm without suppressing that of paradoxical sleep; (2) eliminate the paradoxical sleep theta rhythm without suppressing that of wakefulness. These results suggest that there are two kinds of theta activity having different anatomophysiological bases and a different functional significance: one associated with wakefulness and the other with paradoxical sleep.
