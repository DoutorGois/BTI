Exposure to inescapable footshock provoked region-specific alterations of norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) activity across six strains of mice (A/J, BALB/cByJ, C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6J, DBA/2J and CD-1). The stressor provoked reductions of hypothalamic NE and increased MHPG accumulation in all strains. In contrast, the effects of the stressor on NE activity in the hippocampus and locus coeruleus varied appreciably across strains. In the mesocortex and nucleus accumbens shock induced an increase of DOPAC accumulation and pronounced reductions of DA in some strains, while in others these variations were less pronounced or entirely absent. Stressor-provoked alterations of 5-HT and 5-HIAA were most evident in the mesocortex. Strain-specific neurochemical alterations following footshock are discussed relative to stressor-induced behavioral disturbances and animal models of depression.
