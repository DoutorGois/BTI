The hippocampus is a region in the brain that is crucial for learning and memory. Previous researches proved that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a probable responsible protein in the learning and memory formation process. BDNF content is thought to be affected by environmental enrichment and physical activity. The purpose of this research was to identify the effect of short- and long-term forced exercise on hippocampal BDNF levels. A total of 30 Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups (control, short-term exercise and long-term exercise) and treated by treadmill running based on their group. As the treadmill running period finished, the animals were anesthetized. The hippocampus was dissected out immediately and BDNF content of the samples was assessed by ELISA. None of the exercise paradigms did make any significant change on hippocampal BDNF levels. Although exercise was proposed to up-regulate BDNF levels, these results show that the intensity or the duration of running paradigm used in forced exercise protocols here was not enough to affect BDNF levels in the hippocampus significantly.
