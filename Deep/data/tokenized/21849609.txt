Reactive oxygen species (ROS) modulate neuronal excitability. In the present study we examined the effects of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), a well established ROS, on neuronal activity from two neonatal mouse brain regions, i.e., the pre-Botzinger complex (preBotC) within the ventral respiratory column (VRC) and the CA1 area of the hippocampus. In the preBotC, 2.2 mM H(2)O(2) evoked a transient depression followed by augmentation of neuronal activity. The iron chelator deferoxamine (500 muM) did not prevent H(2)O(2)-mediated neuronal augmentation but prevented the initial depression. Combined application of Fe(2+) and H(2)O(2) only caused depression of the preBotC rhythm. In contrast, H(2)O(2) suppressed neuronal activity in the CA1 region, and this effect was accentuated by coapplication of Fe(2+) and H(2)O(2), suggesting that hydroxyl radical generated by Fenton reaction mediates the effects of H(2)O(2) on CA1 neuronal activity. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were monitored as an index of lipid peroxidation in H(2)O(2)-treated preBotC and CA1 areas. MDA levels were unaltered in H(2)O(2)-treated preBotC, whereas MDA levels were markedly elevated in the CA1 region. These findings suggest that 1) exogenous administration of H(2)O(2) exerts differential effects on neuronal activities of preBotC versus CA1 neuronal populations and 2) H(2)O(2) is a potent modulator of respiratory rhythmogenesis from the preBotC without affecting global oxidative status.
