Lithium chloride microinjections in doses of 100 mkg/mkl into the brain structures of rabbits produce a depressive effect on the subcortical formations. The drug brings down the excitability of the hippocampus, caudate nucleus, mesencephalic reticular formations, thalamus and hypothalamus, raising the excitability of the amygdalae.
