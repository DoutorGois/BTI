Rat hippocampal slices were incubated with neuraminidase from Vibrio Cholerae. This enzyme liberates sialic acid from polysialogangliosides converting them into monosialoganglioside GM1. Thus, the tissue is enriched in GM1 content. Another set of slices was incubated with GM1 itself. Both treatments increased the magnitude of potentiation of synaptic response recorded from pyramidal cell layer following high frequency stimulation of Schaffer collateral-commissural fibers. It is concluded that enrichment of synaptic membranes in GM1 enhances the ability of these nerve endings to be potentiated.
