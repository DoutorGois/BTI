Spatial navigation required the acquisition of at least two complementary processes: the organization of the spatial representation of the environment (declarative learning) and the acquisition of a motor behaviour adapted to the specific context (procedural learning). The potential role of the cerebellum in spatial navigation is part of the debate concerning its role in cognitive function. Experiments ranging from cerebellar patients to animal models have indicated that cerebellar damage affects the processing of spatial information. The main unresolved issue concern the interpretation of these deficits. Is the cerebellum involved in both declarative and procedural components of navigation? Could all deficits in navigation paradigms be interpreted by a deficit in a motor-dependant process? The purpose of this review is to examine different results coming from anatomical data, experimental paradigms and models in order to give a critical answer to this question.
