By means of a new method of the EEG analysis, suitable, in contrast to traditional correlative-spectral analysis, for description of nonlinear processes, the informativeness of high-frequency EEG is proved for evaluation of functional brain state. Evidences are obtained in favour to the hypothesis that in the rabbit neocortex and hippocampus EEG a determinate chaotic component is present whose parameters depend on the area of EEG recording and change together with the change of functional brain state.
