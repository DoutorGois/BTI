Kainic acid (KA)-induced status epilepticus (SE) in adult rats results in extensive neuronal damage throughout the limbic system and the loss of selectively vulnerable neuronal populations, particularly CA3 neurons. We investigated the effects of a short episode of seizure activity on neuronal death elicited by a subsequent prolonged SE episode. A short episode of seizure activity was produced by sub-cutaneous (s.c.) injection of KA followed after 1 h by pentobarbital administration. Twenty-four hours later, KA was administered again, and animals were sacrificed 3 days later. Neuronal damage was estimated by visual analysis of neuronal density. Our results show that a short episode of seizure activity did not produce neuronal damage but almost completely protected vulnerable neurons from KA-induced neuronal damage. These results extend to epileptic tolerance the notion of tolerance previously described in the case of ischemia.
