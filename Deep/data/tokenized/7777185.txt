Centrally active drugs that enhance alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptor-gated currents by increasing the amplitude and duration of fast, excitatory synaptic responses in the hippocampus have recently been described. The effects of the compound 1-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-ylcarbonyl) perperidine (BDP) on associative and non-associative aspects of the classically conditioned eyeblink response in the freely moving rat were examined. Rats injected with BDP blinked significantly more to an acoustic stimulus of 85 dB than did vehicle controls, indicating that the drug enhances alpha responding to discrete auditory cues. Using a less intense stimulus of 80 dB, rats injected with BDP did not exhibit alpha responding or pseudo-conditioning, yet learned the conditioned response at a facilitated rate. These results suggest that increasing excitatory neurotransmission enhances the processing of sensory information and may contribute to subsequent contingency detection.
