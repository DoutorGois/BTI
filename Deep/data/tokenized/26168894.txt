Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitors promote memory by blocking the degradation of cAMP. Existing evidence also shows that neuronal survival and plasticity are dependent on the phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein. In this regard, PDE-4 inhibitors have also been shown to reverse pharmacologically and genetically induced memory impairment in animal models. In the present study, the authors examined the effect of both rolipram and roflumilast (PDE-4 inhibitors) on the impairment of learning and memory observed in hypertensive rats. Deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) salt hypertensive model was used to induce learning and memory deficits. The mRNA expression of different PDE-4 subtypes along with the protein levels of pCREB and BDNF in the hippocampus was quantified. Systolic blood pressure was significantly increased in DOCA salt hypertensive rats when compared to sham operated rats. This effect was reversed by clonidine, an alpha2 receptor agonist, while PDE-4 inhibitors did not. PDE-4 inhibitors significantly improved the time-induced memory deficits in object recognition task (ORT). In DOCA salt hypertensive rats, the gene expression of PDE-4B and PDE-4D was significantly increased. Furthermore, both pCREB and BDNF showed decreased levels of expression in hypertensive rats in comparison to sham operated rats. Repeated administration of PDE-4 inhibitors significantly decreased both PDE-4B and PDE-4D with an increase in the expression of pCREB and BDNF in hypersensitive rats. Also, rolipram, roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide showed a linear increase in the plasma and brain concentrations after ORT. Our present findings suggested that PDE-4 inhibitors ameliorate hypertension-induced learning impairment via cAMP/CREB signaling that regulates BDNF expression downstream in the rat hippocampus.
