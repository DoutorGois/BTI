The influence of a unilateral stereotaxically induced 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) lesion in the dorsolateral hypothalamus on brain serotonin synthesis was evaluated by an autoradiographic method, using labelled alpha-methyl-L-tryptophan (alpha-MTrp). The hypothalamus was selected as the lesion site because it receives well defined and relatively large projections from the raphe nuclei. Data suggest that the unilateral lesion in the dorsolateral hypothalamus had a significant influence (an increase) on the rate of serotonin synthesis in the large majority of ipsilateral brain structures examined. It seems that the effect was the greatest in the hippocampal structures, the thalamus, and the parietal and sensory motor cortices. The average increase in the rate of serotonin synthesis on the lesion side when compared with the contralateral side was between 3% (amygdala) and 52% (dorsal hippocampus; CA3 layer of hippocampus). Since in the sham-injected rats (same volume of saline) there was no obvious injection-contralateral side asymmetry observed (except for two structures, probably affected by the injection needle, which showed a significant difference), we concluded that the effect observed in the present study was most likely related to the 5,7-DHT-induced lesion on the serotonergic terminals in the hypothalamus. Comparison of the rate of synthesis in the dorsal and medial raphe and the pineal body with the rates reported earlier for these structures led us to conclude that either the 5,7-DHT lesion in the hypothalamus did not influence the rates in these structures in their entirety, or the method used was not sensitive enough to reveal this influence. Data reported here also demonstrate how a highly specific tracer (alpha-MTrp), in conjunction with a specific and localized lesion, could aid our understanding of the brain serotonergic system.
