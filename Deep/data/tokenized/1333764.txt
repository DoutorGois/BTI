The effects of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, beta-carboline ZK 93,426 treatment were studied both in NB-lesioned (ibotenic acid) and in unoperated Kuo-Wistar rats in a water maze task. The ZK 93,426 administered in the doses of 1 and 5 mg/kg, 30 min prior to the testing in a water maze apparatus, attenuated the NB lesion-induced spatial navigation deficit, although it had no effect on the performance of unoperated rats. The results suggest functional interactions between GABAergic system and ibotenic acid-induced lesion of the basal forebrain in rats.
