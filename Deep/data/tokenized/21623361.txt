Although individual nerve terminals from the same neuron often differ in neurotransmitter release characteristics, the extent to which endocytic retrieval of synaptic vesicle components differs is unknown. We used high-fidelity optical recordings to undertake a large-scale analysis of endocytosis kinetics of individual boutons in hippocampal rat neurons. Our data indicate that endocytosis kinetics do not differ substantially across boutons from the same cell but instead appear to be controlled at a cell-wide level.
