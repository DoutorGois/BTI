Evoked field potentials were recorded in the CA3 region of rat hippocampal slices to detect whether intracellular Ca2+ stores are involved in the epileptiform effects of the two prototypic GABA(A) antagonists, bicuculline methiodide (BMI) and gabazine (SR-95531; GBZ). Field population spikes gradually increased and became repetitive (epileptiform bursting) in the presence of either BMI (5 microM), or GBZ (5 microM). Thapsigargin (2 microM), a depletor of intracellular Ca2+ stores, reduced the epileptiform effect of BMI, but had no significant effect on the GBZ-induced hyperexcitability. These data suggest that Ca2+ release from intracellular stores participates in the epileptiform response of hippocampal CA3 neurons to BMI, but not in the response to GBZ.
