In order to explore the signal transduction pathway of nitric oxide (NO) related to learning and memory, the effects of intracerebral ventricular injection (icv) of NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) alone or along with ADP-ribosyltransferase (ADPRT) inhibitor nicotinamide (NIC) on learning and memory behavior were investigated in rats. Brain ADPRT activity was analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography. The results showed that SNP (0.36 microgram, icv) facilitated short-term and long-term memory in passive avoidance response and elevated learning and memory ability in active avoidance response. NIC (1.5 mg, icv) blocked the effect of SNP. Training in active avoidance task raised ADPRT activity in hippocampus. Treatment with SNP (icv) before training caused significant elevation of ADPRT activity in hippocampus and cerebral cortex. The results above support the view that ADPRT may be one of the target molecules of NO action.
