The protective effects of mild hypothermia (33 and 29 degrees C) on the neuronal activity, intracellular Ca2+ accumulation and ATP levels during deprivation of oxygen and/or glucose were investigated using guinea pig hippocampal slices. During oxygen and glucose deprivation and oxygen deprivation only, mild hypothermia had only minor effects on the maintenance of neuronal activity and ATP levels, but it suppressed Ca2+ accumulation and drastically improved the reversibility of neuronal activity. During glucose deprivation only, mild hypothermia could maintain the neuronal activity as well as ATP levels.
