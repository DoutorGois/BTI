Reactions of neurons of pons varolii reticular and proprial nuclei to stimulation of the frontobasal regions of the cortex (proreal, orbital and basal temporal regions) and dorsal hippocampus were studied in cat. The stimulation of various cortical structures caused phasic and rarely tonic reactions of these neurons. Primary excitation was the dominant type of reactions in the reticular nuclei and primary inhibition--in the proprial nuclei. The greatest number of responding neurons was observed during stimulation of the proreal gyrus. In the cerebro-cerebellar system the most responsible neurons were those of nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis and ventromedial part of the pontine grey matter. The regions of dominant influence from the cortical structures were in the same zones of the pontine reticular formation, where neurons with rostral projection are localized.
