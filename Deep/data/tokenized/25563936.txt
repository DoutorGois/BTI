We report a two-photon fluorescent probe for ratiometric imaging of cysteamine in situ. This probe can detect the levels of endogenous cysteamine with statistical significance in live cells and brain hippocampal tissues, revealing that cysteamine is localized mainly in the perikaria of the pyramidal neurons and the granule cells.
