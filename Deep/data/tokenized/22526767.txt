Although some studies have investigated the influence of kindling model of epilepsy on the glutamatergic neurotransmission, the relation between glutamatergic receptors and seizure susceptibility remains unclear. The present study sought to determine if rats with high (HTR) and low (LTR) thresholds to clonic convulsions induced by the benzodiazepine inverse agonist DMCM differed in the [(3)H]-L-glutamate binding to membranes from discrete brain regions. Compared to the HTR subgroup, the LTR subgroup presented a lower binding of [(3)H]-L-glutamate in the hippocampus, frontal cortex and amygdala plus limbic cortex, suggesting that glutamatergic receptors in these brain regions may underlie the susceptibility to DMCM-induced convulsions.
