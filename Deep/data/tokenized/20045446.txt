Adult neurogenesis occurs most notably in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and in the olfactory bulb (OB) where new neurons are generated from neural progenitors cells produced in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the forebrain. As it is well known that gonadal steroid hormones, primarily estradiol, modulate neurogenesis in the hippocampus of adult female rodents, we wanted to determine whether estradiol would also affect the proliferation of progenitor cells in the SVZ and by consequence the rate of newly generated cells in the main OB. Thus a first group of adult female C57Bl6/J mice was ovariectomized and received a short term treatment with estradiol (single injection of 1 or 10 microg 17beta-estradiol or Silastic capsule of estradiol during 2 days) before receiving a single injection with BrdU to determine whether estradiol would modulate the cell proliferation in the SVZ. A second group of adult ovariectomized female mice was submitted to the same estradiol treatment before receiving four BrdU injections, and was sacrificed 21 days later to determine whether a modulation in cell proliferation actually leads to a modulation in the number of newborn cells in the main OB. We observed a decrease in cell proliferation in the SVZ following either dose of estradiol compared to the controls. Furthermore, 21 days after their generation in the SVZ, the number of BrdU labeled cells was also lower in the main OB, both in the granular and periglomerular cell layers of estradiol-treated animals. These results show that a short term treatment with estradiol actually downregulates cell proliferation leading to a decreased number of newborn cells in the OB.
