The influence of maternal chronic alcoholism on fetal brain development was investigated in rats. A decrease in the activity of succinate, glycerin-1-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenases and of tetrazolium reductases was found. The amount of total RNA was reduced in the neonates with alcohol damage. Moreover, a retardation of myelinisation at the time of birth was observed.
