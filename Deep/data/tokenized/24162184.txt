Recent studies have revealed that microglial hyperactivation and neuroinflammation are implicated in development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we examined the beneficial effects of 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) and indole-3-carbinol (I3C), dietary components found in cruciferous vegetables, on brain inflammation. DIM, a major metabolite of I3C, suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 in BV-2 microglia, but I3C did not. DIM, but not I3C, attenuated DNA-binding activity of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and phosphorylation of inhibitor of kappaB, suggesting that DIM might inhibit microglial hyperactivation by attenuating inflammatory transcription factor NF-kappaB. In addition, DIM, but not I3C, protected primary cortical neurons from inflammatory toxicity induced by the conditioned media from LPS-stimulated BV-2 microglia, indicating that DIM might attenuate microglial hyperactivation-mediated neuronal death. In an in vivo model of neuroinflammation, DIM suppressed LPS-induced brain inflammation in mouse hippocampus, as determined by the number of Iba-1-positive cells and the mRNA expression of F4/80. Taken together, these results suggest that DIM may have beneficial potential against brain inflammation and neurodegenerative diseases through the negative regulation of the NF-kappaB signal pathway in microglia.
