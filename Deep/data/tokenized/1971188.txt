The effects of withdrawal on the level and specific binding of somatostatin in the frontoparietal cortex and hippocampus of the rat after chronic haloperidol treatment were examined using 125I-Tyr11 somatostatin as tracer. One week after haloperiodol withdrawal the number of specific somatostatin receptors in both brain areas returned to control values, after having decreased as the result of chronic administration. Neither administration of haloperidol nor withdrawal of it affected the levels of somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SLI) in the two brain areas studied. The return of the somatostatin receptor number to control values after haloperidol withdrawal may be related to the motor side-effects that are clinically observed when the haloperidol treatment is terminated.
