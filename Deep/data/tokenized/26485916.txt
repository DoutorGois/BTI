OBJECTIVE: To observe the evolutionary tendency of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) of the limbic system in post-stroke model rats and the intervention effect of Yinao Jieyu Recipe (YJR). METHODS: Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into the normal control group (n =6), the sham-operation group (n =7), the multiple cerebral infarction (MCI) group (n =10), the post-stroke depression (PSD) group (n =10), the Chinese medicine (CM) treatment group (n =10), and the Western medicine (WM) treatment group (n =10) according to random digit table after open-field testing. Rats in the normal control group were routinely fed. 0. 3 mL normal saline was intravenously pushing from the external carotid artery to rats in the sham-operation group, and distilled water administered to them by gastrogavage. Each dose allogenic microthrombi were in vitro pushed to rats in the rest groups from the external carotid artery. The PSD model was duplicated by 21-day chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and single cage feeding in the PSD group 7 days after surgery. After preparing models rats in the CM group and the WM group were administered with YJR and Nimodipine respectively for 4 successive weeks. Changes of BDNF and the intervention effect of YJR were observed at week 1, 2, and 4 after intervention. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical results of BDNF showed, compared with the normal control group, expression levels of BDNF in the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and amygdala decreased in the MCI group at week 2 and 4 (P <0. 01 , P <0. 05) ; expression levels of BDNF in each part decreased in the PSD group at week 1-4 (P <0.01). Compared with the MCI group, expression levels of BDNF in each part decreased in the PSD group at week 1-4 (P <0. 01). Compared with the PSD group, expression levels of BDNF in each part increased in the CM group at week 1-4 (P <0. 01). CONCLUSION: BDNF changes existed in post-stroke model rats, and YJR could slow down this progress.
