CONTEXT: Hypericum caprifoliatum Cham & Schlecht (Guttiferae) extracts have a potential antidepressant-like effect in rodents. However, the molecular mechanisms by which these extracts exert this effect remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the effect of HC1, a fraction obtained from H. caprifoliatum enriched in phloroglucinol derivatives, on the Na(+), K(+) ATPase activity in mouse brain and verified the influence of veratrine on the effect of HC1 in the forced swimming test (FST). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Veratrine (0.06 mg/kg) and HC1 (360 mg/kg) were given alone or combined i.p. 60 and p.o. 30 min, respectively, before FST. The effect of single and repeated administration (once a day for 3 consecutive days) of HC1 (360 mg/kg) on Na(+), K(+) ATPase activity was evaluated ex vivo in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of mice subjected or not to FST. RESULTS: HC1 reduced the immobility time (103.15 +/- 18.67 s), when compared to the control group (183.6 +/- 9.51 s). This effect was prevented by veratrine (151.75 +/- 22.19 s). Mice repeatedly treated with HC1 presented a significant increase in Na(+), K(+) ATPase activity, both in cerebral cortex (46 +/- 2.41 nmol Pi/min.mg protein) and hippocampus (49.83 +/- 2.31 nmol Pi/min.mg protein), in relation to the respective controls (30 +/- 2.66 and 29.83 +/- 2.31 nmol Pi/min.mg protein respectively). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The HC1 antidepressant-like effect on FST might be related to its capacity to inhibit Na(+) influx. HC1 increases hippocampal and cortical Na(+), K(+) ATPase activities possibly through long-term regulatory mechanisms.
