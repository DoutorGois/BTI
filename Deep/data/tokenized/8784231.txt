Brain slice glucose utilization (SGU) can be measured by methods analogous to those used for in vivo cerebral glucose utilization. In order to make this technique more accessible and applicable to a broad range of experimental conditions, we have derived a simplified operational rate equation and generated the table of apparent rate coefficients necessary to apply the equation under different experimental situations. Calculations of the apparent rate coefficients were based upon an eight-parameter kinetic model combined with Michaelis-Menten theory to account for changes in the rate constants as a function of buffer glucose concentration. The theory was tested with a series of experiments using rat brain slices. [14C]-2-deoxyglucose (2DG) and [14C]-3-O-methylglucose (3OMG). The errors involved in the simplified technique were estimated by a variety of techniques and found to be acceptable over a broad range of conditions. A detailed, practical protocol for the simplified method is presented.
