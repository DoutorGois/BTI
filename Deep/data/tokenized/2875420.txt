The contribution of excitatory inputs to CA1 pyramidal cell death after ischemia was examined using rats with unilateral destruction of CA3 pyramidal cells. Intracerebroventricular injection of L-alpha-kainic acid (KA) was performed before the induction of transient forebrain ischemia. Five days after ischemic insult, pyramidal cells and L-glutamate binding sites in the CA1 region ipsilateral to the KA injection were preserved in spite of neuronal necrosis and a significant decrease in L-glutamate receptor density in the contralateral CA1 region, indicating the critical role of Schaffer collaterals in delayed neuronal death.
