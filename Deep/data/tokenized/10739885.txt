Recent studies have demonstrated the involvements of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter systems in the schizophrenic brain. In order to further elucidate the alterations of this system in schizophrenia, we employed immunohistochemical techniques and examined the expression and anatomical distribution of the GABA(B) receptor in the hippocampus of five subjects with schizophrenia and three age-matched controls. In the control hippocampus, the most intense immunoreactivity was observed in the soma and processes of multipolar interneurons throughout the hippocampus. Pyramidal cells too were intensely labeled in their soma and proximal portion of dendrites, although the labeling intensity was varied in each subregion. For example, in the CA1 subfield, the labeling intensity of pyramidal cells was much less intense than that in the CA3 and CA2 subfields. In the subjects with schizophrenia, GABA(B) immunoreactivity was markedly reduced in granule cells as well as in pyramidal cells throughout the CA fields. In interneurons, GABA(B) labeling was relatively preserved compared to that in pyramidal cells. Our findings suggest that in the hippocampus of schizophrenic patients the expression of the GABA(B) receptor is reduced, and raise the possibility that this reduction contributes to the pathophysiological process in the schizophrenic brain.
