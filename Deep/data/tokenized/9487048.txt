A seizure-protecting effect of the delta-sleep-inducing peptide (DSIP) and its analogues was revealed. An intensive sorption of H3 tryptophan occurred under the effect of the DSIP and its analogues. The data obtained suggests that the serotoninergic system plays no important part in the seizure-protecting effect.
