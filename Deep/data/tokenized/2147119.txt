Excessive Ca2+ influx through NMDA receptor-coupled channels has been linked to neuronal cell death. Using an in vitro model of transient brain ischemia, we investigated possible protective effects of NMDA receptor antagonists ketamine or MK-801 and of calmidazolium, an inhibitor of intracellular Ca2(+)-activated proteins. Brain ischemia/recovery was simulated in isolated hippocampal slices and injury monitored by measurement of ATP levels. Omission of both glucose and oxygen (but not oxygen alone) for 20 min led to persistent ATP deficits after 4 h recovery. Addition of ketamine or MK-801 at 1 microM permitted ATP to recover within 1 h, as did addition of calmidazolium at 10 microM. Our findings are consistent with other reports that NMDA receptor antagonists can protect neuronal tissue from ischemic damage. The role of inappropriately activated Ca2(+)-mediated signaling processes in the mechanism(s) of such injury is suggested by the protection also seen with calmidazolium, an inhibitor of calmodulin and other structurally related proteins such as calpain(s) and protein kinase C. The inhibition of intracellular Ca2+ target proteins may be an alternative for protection of the brain against injury due to insults that activate NMDA receptors.
