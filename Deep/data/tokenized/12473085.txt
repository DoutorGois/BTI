In 28- to 30-month-old rats, in vitro short-term and long-term potentiation (STP and LTP) were measured in area CA1 of the hippocampus in seven superior and seven inferior learners, that were selected from a pool of 40 rats based on water maze escape performance over a period of 9 days. The aim was to examine whether levels of STP and LTP could account for group differences in learning of water maze escape, spatial preference and wall (thigmotaxis)-avoidance and in short-term retention of an inhibitory avoidance task. There was no significant group difference in open-field exploration, i.e. the number of rearings. In contrast to expectation, the superior and inferior learners did not differ significantly from each other in levels of STP and LTP. However, variability in escape and spatial learning, but not thigmotaxis-avoidance learning, was significantly predicted by variability in STP and LTP in the superior group. Also, open-field exploratory rearings were significantly correlated with STP and LTP as well as with maze escape learning in the superior group. The results show that, in the aged superior group, levels of CA1 STP and LTP coincided with residual water maze escape and spatial preference learning as well as open-field exploration, i.e. behavioural expressions known to be related to hippocampal functioning, but not with learning to avoid thigmotaxis in the maze. The lack of such correlations in the inferior group may be due to the severe impairment in escape and spatial preference learning and/or the influence of yet unknown third variables on these relationships.
