Electrical kindling of the amygdala and hippocampus was used to evaluate the effects of two formamidines, chlordimeform (CDF) and amitraz (AMZ), upon seizures susceptibility in the rat. Male Long-Evans rats were implanted with electrodes in the amygdala or dorsal dentate gyrus, and injected IP daily with 40 mg/kg CDF, 50 mg/kg AMZ, or equal volumes of their respective vehicles. Afterdischarge (AD) thresholds were determined after the first injection. Animals were then stimulated twice daily, 2 and 4 hours postinjeciton, at a standard 200 microA stimulus intensity until three stage 5 generalized seizures ensued. Both CDF and AMZ significantly facilitated amygdaloid kindling rate, and CDF also facilitated hippocampal kindling rate. The effects of AMZ on hippocampal kindling were not assessed. AD durations were prolonged in the formamidine-treated groups, but there was no effect on AD thresholds. The alpha-2 adrenergic agonist and/or local anesthetic-like properties of these compounds may be responsible for these seizure enhancing effects.
