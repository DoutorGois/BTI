H19-7/IGF-IR cells are rat hippocampal cells expressing a human IGF-I receptor, which differentiate to a neuronal phenotype when stimulated by IGF-I at 39 degrees C. H19-7/IGF-IR cells have low levels of expression of insulin receptor substrate-l (IRS-1), a major substrate of the IGF-IR. IGF-I induces serine-phosphorylation and down-regulation of the endogenous IRS-1 upon differentiation of H19-7/IGF-IR cells. The profound influence of IRS-1 on differentiation of H19-7/IGF-IR cells was confirmed by transfecting these cells with a plasmid expressing mouse IRS-1. Over-expression of wild type IRS-1 in H19-7/IGF-IR cells abolishes IGF-I-induced differentiation at 39 degrees C. A mutant of IRS-1 lacking the PTB domain loses the ability to inhibit the differentiation program. H19-7/IGF-IR/IRS-1 cells at 39 degrees C show a stronger and prolonged activation of Akt, when compared to H19-7/IGF-IR cells. The role of Akt in the inhibition of the differentiation program was confirmed by using the inhibitor of Class I PI3 kinases LY29400, which restores IGF-I-induced differentiation of H19-7/IGF-IR/IRS-1 cells. H19-7/IGF-IR/IRS-1 cells show a strong reduction in MAP kinases signaling, which is related to the superactivation of Akt. This was confirmed by expressing in H19-7/IGF-IR cells a constitutively active Akt, which inhibited MAP kinases activation in these cells. These experiments confirm the importance of MAPK in the mechanism of IGF-I-mediated differentiation of H19-7/IGF-IR cells
