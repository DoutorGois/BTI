Using an in vitro incubation method, we stimulated cGMP production in rat brain slices by rat ANF-(103 - 126). The localization of the cells responding to this ANF stimulation with an increase in cGMP production was studied by cGMP immunocytochemistry. ANF-responding cells were found in specific loci throughout the central nervous system of the rat. Regions containing the highest number of these cells were: the olfactory bulb, the lateral septum, the bed nucleus of the accessory olfactory tract, the mediobasal amygdala, the central grey area, the medial vestibular nucleus, and the nucleus of the solitary tract. Scattered ANF-responding, cGMP-immunoreactive cells were found in the hippocampus, the cingulate cortex, the ventral pallidum, the medial preoptic area, and the endopeduncular nucleus. ANF-responding cells in these areas had the same morphology, that is, multipolar with numerous processes. The nature of these ANF-responding cells was studied by sequential staining with an antiserum against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). In the hippocampus it was demonstrated that all ANF-responding cells are astroglial cells. However, not all astroglial cells in this area showed a cGMP response, demonstrating a regional heterogeneity. ANF-responding cells, having the appearance of neuronal cell bodies, could be found in the subfornical organ, and the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. Fibres producing cGMP immunoreactivity in response to ANF were found in the median preoptic nucleus, the medial preoptic area, and the dorsal hypothalamus.
