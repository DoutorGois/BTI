The present study utilized event-related fMRI to address the role of the human perirhinal cortex (PRC), and its interactions with the hippocampus, in memory consolidation. Participants encoded object-based and scene-based associations and then restudied them either after a "long" or "short" delay during which consolidation could occur. We found that BOLD activation in left PRC and hippocampal-PRC functional connectivity were significantly enhanced during the restudy of the long versus short delay word-object pairs. Secondly, hippocampal-PRC connectivity during restudy of the long delay word-object pairs predicted a subsequent reduction in associative forgetting. By contrast, hippocampal-PRC connectivity did not predict subsequent resistance to forgetting for the short delay or novel associations. Together, these results provide evidence for perirhinal-hippocampal interactions in the selective consolidation of object-based associative memories and provide support for the notion that, during early stages of consolidation, memories become more distributed across brain regions.
