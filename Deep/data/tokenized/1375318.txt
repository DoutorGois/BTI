The binding characteristics of [3H]L-689,560 [(+/-)-4-(trans)-2-carboxy-5,7-dichloro-4-phenylaminocarbonylamino -1,2,3,4- tetrahydroquinoline], a selective antagonist for the glycine site on the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, have been evaluated using rat cortex/hippocampus P2 membranes. Specific [3H]L-689,560 binding was saturable, having a Kd of 2.97 nM and a Bmax of 4.15 pmol/mg of protein. The Bmax value was not significantly different from that obtained for [3H]glycine in the same membrane preparation, and L-689,560 and glycine were found to be mutually competitive. The specific binding of [3H]L-689,560 (1 nM) represented 96 +/- 0.02% (four experiments) of total binding. Association experiments at 4 degrees revealed that [3H]L-689,560 reached equilibrium in 120 min, with a t1/2 of 40 min. The dissociation of [3H]L-689,560 was slow at 4 degrees (t1/2 = 118 min), allowing the use of filtration to separate free from bound radioactivity. Both association and dissociation curves were best fitted by a double-exponential function, suggesting the presence of two components. Comparison of IC50 values obtained using [3H]glycine and [3H]L-689,560 binding for 21 glycine site ligands (including agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists, with affinities spanning 5 orders of magnitude) showed a 1:1 correlation, with a correlation coefficient of 0.97. This suggests that efficacy does not have a large influence on the affinity of glycine site ligands when an agonist or antagonist radioligand is used. Ligands for other amino acid recognition sites did not directly inhibit [3H]L-689,560 binding. [3H]L-689,560 is an improved radioligand for the glycine site that will facilitate further investigations of its properties.
