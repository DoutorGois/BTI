The anatomical organization and development of the hippocampal mossy fiber system has been reviewed with special reference to its organization in the common laboratory rat. The mossy fibers originate from the granule cells of the dentate granular layer and the few granule cells found scattered in the dentate molecular layer and hilus. Via a complex system of collaterals the mossy fibers terminate on several types of neurons in the hilus, e.g. the basket cells and the mossy cells. Upon leaving the hilus to pass into Ammon's horn, the mossy fibers converge to form a distinct band of fibers that terminates on the proximal part of the apical and basal dendrites of the pyramidal and basket cells of the regio inferior. In some mammalian species the mossy fibers may continue into the adjacent part of the regio superior. Despite differences in the number of granule cells and pyramidal cells at different septotemporal levels this organization is relatively uniform along the septotemporal extent of the hippocampus. During development the mossy fibers grow out in a sequential manner that matches the pattern of neurogenesis and the aggregation of the cells of origin. From the level at which they originate, the fibers diverge along the septotemporal axis in such a way that the oldest granule cells have the most extensive projections. The adult topographic organization, which is already apparent at the earliest developmental stages, is thus formed in a stepwise fashion. It is concluded that the organization of the hippocampal mossy fibers indicates that neuronal specificity should not be explained by cellular recognition alone, but rather as the cumulated product of the preceding sequence of developmental events that include neurogenesis, migration, aggregation and directed axonal outgrowth.
