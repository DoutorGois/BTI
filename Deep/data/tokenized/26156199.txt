Alpha-soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) attachment protein (alphaSNAP) is a ubiquitous and indispensable component of membrane fusion machinery. There is accumulating evidence that mild alterations of alphaSNAP expression may be associated with specific pathological conditions in several neurological disorders. This study aimed to assess alphaSNAP expression in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients and pilocarpine-induced rat model and to determine whether altered alphaSNAP expression leads to increased susceptibility to seizures. The expression of alphaSNAP was assessed in the temporal lobe from patients with TLE and pilocarpine-induced epileptic rats. In addition, alphaSNAP expression was silenced by lentivirus pLKD-CMV-GFP-U6-NAPA (primer: GGAAGCATGCGAGATCTATGC) in animals. At day 7, the animals were kindled by pilocarpine and then the time of latency to seizure and the incidence of chronic idiopathic epilepsy seizures were assessed. The immunoreactivity to alpha-SNAP was utilized to measure expression of this protein in the animal. By immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and western blotting, we found significantly lower alphaSNAP levels in patients with TLE. alphaSNAP expression showed no obvious change in pilocarpine-induced epileptic rats, from 6 h to 3 days after seizure, compared with the control group, in the acute stage; however, alphaSNAP levels were significantly lower in the chronic phase (day 7, months 1 and 2) in epileptic rats. Importantly, behavioral data revealed that alphaSNAP-small interfering RNA (siRNA) could decrease the time of latency to seizure and increase the incidence of chronic idiopathic epilepsy seizures compared with the control group. alphaSNAP is mainly expressed in the neuron brain tissue of patients with TLE and epileptic animals. Our findings suggest that decreasing alphaSNAP levels may increase epilepsy susceptibility, providing a new strategy for the treatment of this disease.
