This study examined the role of hippocampal dopamine D2 receptors in the genesis of limbic seizures induced by muscarinic agonists in the rat. Pilocarpine, 600 mg/kg, elicited rapid and usually fatal convulsions. These were not affected by focal injections of saline (1 microliter) into both hippocampi. Pretreatment of the dorsal, but not the lateral hippocampus, with the D2 agonist trans-(+)-4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a,9-octahydro-5-propyl-2H-pyrazolo-(3,4-g)quinol ine hydrochloride (LY 171555, 2 micrograms per side), did not alter the frequency of pilocarpine-induced convulsions, but significantly delayed their appearance and reduced their intensity. LY 171555 similarly increased the latency of seizures induced by focal hippocampal injection of carbachol (100 micrograms), without changing the frequency or the severity. The selective D2 antagonist raclopride, injected dorsally into both hippocampi dose-dependently facilitated motor seizures evoked by pilocarpine (100 mg/kg), the cholinomimetic at this dose being ineffective as a convulsant in saline-treated animals. Intrahippocampal administration of the D1 agonist 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-7,8-dihydroxy-1-phenyl-1H-3-benzazepine hydrochloride (SKF 38393, 2 micrograms per side) did not facilitate pilocarpine seizures and did not potentiate the proconvulsant action of raclopride. These data demonstrate that activation of the dopaminergic system, via D2 receptors in the dorsal hippocampus, is capable of protecting the animal against limbic motor seizures arising from excessive muscarinic stimulation of the hippocampus. Since the blockade of D2 receptors in the hippocampus markedly lowered the seizure threshold to pilocarpine, this would suggest that the dopaminergic input to the hippocampus is normally tonically active and functions physiologically to prevent epileptogenesis.
