It was previously reported by the authors that long-term diphenyl-hydantoin (DPH) administration impaired the learning behavior in the developing mice. The aim of the present study was to find out whether prolonged administration of DPH would affect the levels of monamine metabolites in the cerebral cortices and hippocampi of the developing mice. Each of the experimental animals was treated intraperitoneally with a dose of DPH of 25mg/kg q.d. for 50 days. The monamine metabolites were measured with high performance liquid chromatography. The results showed that chronic administration of DPH caused a significant elevation of the concentrations of 5-hydroxytryptamine(5-HT), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and dihydroxy-phenyl acetic acid (DOPAC) in the cerebral cortices and hippocampi, whereas it did not raise the concentrations of dopamine (DA), homovanillic acid (HVA) and norepinephrine (NE) in these two brain regions. This suggested that DPH mainly enhanced the function of 5-HT in the brains. It was postulated that the elevation of the concentrations of 5-HT and 5-HIAA in the cerebral cortices and hippocampi might be responsible for the adverse effect of DPH on the learning behavior in the developing mice.
