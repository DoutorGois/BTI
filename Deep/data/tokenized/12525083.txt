Sodium fluoride added with or without sodium selenite in deionized water was administered to male mice for 8 weeks. The influences of fluoride on learning-memory behavior were tested on Y-maze, and the ultrastructure of Gray I synaptic interface in the CA3 area hippocampus was quantitatively analyzed by electron microscopy and computer image processing appliance. The main results showed that the learning capability of mice drinking higher concentration of fluoride presented remarkable deterioration. The thickness of post-synaptic density (PSD) was decreased. The width of the synaptic cleft was remarkably increased. It was found that combined administration of fluoride and proper concentration of selenium could decrease the toxic effect of fluoride. There were synergetic toxicities if the concentration of selenium was too high. The results suggested that selenium might antagonize the neurotoxicity of fluoride on behavior and morphology.
