Nuclear extracts from hippocampi, striata and hypothalami of postnatal day (P) 7 rats contained elevated basal levels of AP-1 DNA binding activity and c-jun protein, which decreased to the low basal levels observed in the adult by P21. In contrast to the AP-1 DNA binding complex in the adult brain, the fos-related antigens were not a major component of the P7 AP-1 DNA binding activity.
