Introducing theta-modulated input into a minimal model of the CA3 region of the hippocampus has significant effects on gamma oscillations. In the absence of theta-modulated input, the gamma oscillations are robust across a range of parameters. Introducing theta-modulated input weakens the gamma oscillations to a power more consistent with power spectra acquired from laboratory animals. With these changes, simulations of the hippocampal model are able to reproduce hippocampal power spectra measured in awake mice.
