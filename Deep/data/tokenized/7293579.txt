An analysis of the results of examining 50 operated epileptic patients has shown that the use of short- and ultrashort-acting analeptics and barbiturates makes it possible to specify not only the location of the epileptic focus, but also to disclose the character of the interrelations between the elements of the epileptic system. Especially valuable data can be obtained with the use of brietal. The use of analeptics is the most promising in the course of operation, and, therefore, it should be limited to the preoperational period. It is suggested that the method of implanting permanent intracerebral electrodes acquires now not only diagnostic, but primarily therapeutic importance.
