The pathogenesis of the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may involve dysfunction of several brain structures, such as the amygdala, locus coeruleus, hippocampus, noradrenergic system as well as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The cortisol and locus coeruleus dysfunction may affect the secretion of corticosterone. The present study was designed to examine the expression of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the locus coeruleus in the rats treated with single-prolonged stress (SPS). The results showed that the expression of MR had a sharp decline on day 1, but gradually increased on days 4, 7, 14, and 28. The expression of GR gradually increased on days 1, 4, and 7, but decreased on days 14 and 28, respectively.MR and GR in the locus coeruleus may have a role in the development of long-term persistent neuropsychological sequelae in PTSD.
