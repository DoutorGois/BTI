Hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) process spatiotemporally discrete events while maintaining goal-directed task demands. Although some studies have reported that neural activities in the two regions are coordinated, such observations have rarely been reported in an object-place paired-associate (OPPA) task in which animals must learn an object-in-place rule. In this study, we recorded single units and local field potentials simultaneously from the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus and PFC as rats learned that Object A, but not Object B, was rewarded in Place 1, but not in Place 2 (vice versa for Object B). Both hippocampus and PFC are required for normal performance in this task. PFC neurons fired in association with the regularity of the occurrence of a certain type of event independent of space, whereas neuronal firing in CA1 was spatially localized for representing a discrete place. Importantly, the differential firing patterns were observed in tandem with common learning-related changes in both regions. Specifically, once OPPA learning occurred and rats used an object-in-place strategy, (1) both CA1 and PFC neurons exhibited spatially more similar and temporally more synchronized firing patterns, (2) spiking activities in both regions were more phase locked to theta rhythms, and (3) CA1-medial PFC coherence in theta oscillation was maximal before entering a critical place for decision making. The results demonstrate differential as well as common neural dynamics between hippocampus and PFC in acquiring the OPPA task and strongly suggest that both regions form a unified functional network for processing an episodic event.
