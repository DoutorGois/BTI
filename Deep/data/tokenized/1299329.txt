Live neuronal suspensions, prepared from the hippocampal region of donors aged 20 embryonal days, were observed in the Nomarski Differential Interference Contrast. Many neurones displayed profiles, resembling dendrites or axons and both principal hippocampal neurones (pyramidal and granular cells) were identified. For transplantation studies, donors of a younger embryonal age are thus recommended.
