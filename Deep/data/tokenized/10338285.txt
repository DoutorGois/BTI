We performed fast Fourier transformation power spectral analysis of the electrocorticogram in human medial temporal lobe during wakeful rest in six epileptic subjects. Compared with the electrocorticogram wave in the basal temporal lobe, which showed monotonic decline of spectral power across the frequency axis, the electrocorticogram wave in the parahippocampal gyrus was enhanced (or did not decline) in the gamma frequency range (30-150 Hz) in all subjects. Although it has been suggested that electrical oscillations of the hippocampus have functional roles in higher brain functions, namely learning and memory, the knowledge of hippocampal oscillations is largely limited to animal studies. The present results demonstrate that fast frequency oscillation is also present in the human medial temporal lobe, which has been reported in animal hippocampi. They also demonstrate the importance of recording very fast field potentials in human electrocorticograms. This fast oscillation is likely to play important functional roles related to learning and memory, possibly to induce long-term potentiation in the human medial temporal lobe.
