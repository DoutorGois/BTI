Afferent connections of LP of the thalamus and parietal area 7 from the retrosplenial cortex of rat were investigated by means of the HRP retrograde transport. It was shown that neurons of area 29d sent afferent fibres to LP, while area 7 received axons from cells of areas 29d and 29c. Those projections were ipsilateral. It was found out that connections to the associative cortex were more massive than those to the thalamus. Projections from areas 29a and 29b were not revealed. Apart from the neocortical input area 7 received afferent fibres from the archicortex. Neurons of hippocampal area CA1 were a source of those projections.
