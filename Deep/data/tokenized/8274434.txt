Mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) in neurons of the anterior hypothalamus and the periventricular brain regions mediate aldosterone-selective actions on sodium homeostasis, salt appetite and cardiovascular regulation. Corticosterone is not effective in these neurons, possibly because it is enzymatically inactivated. However, MRs in limbic brain regions, notably in the hippocampal neurons, do already respond to very low concentrations of both corticosterone and aldosterone. The MR-mediated effects stabilize neuronal transmission and appear critical for neuronal integrity of a sub-region of the hippocampus: the dentate gyrus. Higher concentrations of corticosterone induced by stress and the circadian rise progressively activate the lower affinity glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), which in coordination with MR-mediated actions then facilitate adaptive processes required for recovery of homeostasis. It is postulated that this balanced MR- and GR-mediated action of corticosterone is of critical importance for regulation of the stress response and behavioural adaptation.
