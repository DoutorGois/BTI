Since stress plays a role in the onset and physiopathology of psychiatric diseases, animal models of chronic stress may offer insights into pathways operating in mood disorders. The aim of this study was to identify the molecular changes induced in rat hippocampus by repeated exposure to psychosocial stress with a proteomic technique. In the social defeat model, the experimental animal was defeated by a dominant male eight times. Additional groups of rats were submitted to a single defeat or placed in an empty cage (controls). The open field test was carried out on parallel animal groups. The day after the last exposure, levels of hippocampal proteins were compared between groups after separation by 2-D gel electrophoresis and image analysis. Spots showing significantly altered levels were submitted to peptide fingerprinting mass spectrometry for protein identification. The intensity of 69 spots was significantly modified by repeated stress and 21 proteins were unambiguously identified, belonging to different cellular functions, including protein folding, signal transduction, synaptic plasticity, cytoskeleton regulation and energy metabolism. This work identified molecular changes in protein levels caused by exposure to repeated psychosocial stress. The pattern of changes induced by repeated stress was quantitatively and qualitatively different from that observed after a single exposure. Several changed proteins have already been associated with stress-related responses; some of them are here described for the first time in relation to stress.
