OBJECTIVE: To observe the dynamics of hippocampal release of glutamate (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in epilepsy (TLE) after administration with high frequency stimulation (HFS). METHODS: The SD were divided into four groups (n =10): (1) Control group (KB) the rats were injected intraperitoneally with saline 0.9%. (2) Kainic acid (KA) group: the rats were injected with KA. (3) Pseudo-deep brain stimulation (DBS) group: the KA-induced rats were implanted with rheophores alone. (4) DBS group: KA induced-rats with DBS in hippocampal epileptic foci. We then collected hippocampal extracellular fluid by microdialysis and the levels of Glu and GABA were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and fluorescence detection. RESULTS: There was no difference in the baseline of Glu and GABA in the four groups. In contrast, a significant increase in the content of Glu and GABA was shown in the three periods of KA-kindled seizures. Electrical stimulation of hippocampus resulted in a decrease of hippocampal Glu contents, while there was no change in GABA contents. Additionally, HFS of hippocampus normalized the Glu/GABA ratio in the chronic period of seizures. CONCLUSION: The high frequency stimulation of epileptic foci may protect against seizures by modulating the extracellular release of hippocampal Glu.
