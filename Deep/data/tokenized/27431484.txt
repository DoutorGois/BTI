ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10) is a member of the ADAMs family, which is key in the development of the nervous system, by regulating proliferation, migration, differentiation and survival of various cells, including axonal growth and myelination. Previous studies have investigated the embryonic or postnatal expression of ADAM10, however, detailed information regarding its cellular distribution in the adult stage, to the best of our knowledge, is not available. The present study investigated the expression pattern of the ADAM10 gene in the adult mouse central nervous system (CNS) using an ADAM10 complementary RNA probe for in situ hybridization (ISH). Immunohistochemical staining was used to identify the type of the ISH stainingpositive cells with neuron or astrocytespecific antibodies. The results of the current study demonstrated that the ADAM10 gene was predominantly expressed in the neurons of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus and cerebellar granular cells in adult mouse CNS.
