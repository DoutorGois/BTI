In associative priming, rats are more likely to orient to a visual stimulus whose memory has not been recently activated (V1) than to one whose memory has been recently activated (V2). However, rats with excitotoxic hippocampal lesions are more likely to orient to the primed V2 than to the unprimed V1. This study investigated the influence of hippocampal lesions on nonassociative priming. Rats received presentations of 2 visual stimuli, V1 and V2, that had been presented more (V2, primed) or less (V1, unprimed) recently. Control rats oriented to V1 rather than to V2, whereas hippocampal rats oriented to V2 rather than to V1. These results parallel those observed in an associative priming procedure and thereby suggest that the role of the hippocampus in priming is general.
