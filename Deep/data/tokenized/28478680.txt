beta-Amyloid (Abeta) can form aggregates through self-assembly and produce neurotoxicity in the early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, the inhibition of Abeta assembly is considered as the primary target for AD therapy. In this study, we reported that fucoxanthin, a marine carotenoid, potently reduced the formation of Abeta fibrils and oligomers. Moreover, the fucoxanthin-triggered modification significantly reduced the neurotoxicity of Abeta oligomers in vitro. Molecular dynamics simulation analysis further revealed a hydrophobic interaction between fucoxanthin and Abeta peptide, which might prevent the conformational transition and self-assembly of Abeta. Most importantly, fucoxanthin could attenuate cognitive impairments in Abeta oligomer-injected mice. In addition, fucoxanthin significantly inhibited oxidative stress, enhanced the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and increased ChAT-positive regions in the hippocampus of mice. On the basis of these novel findings, we anticipated that fucoxanthin might ameliorate AD via inhibiting Abeta assembly and attenuating Abeta neurotoxicity.
