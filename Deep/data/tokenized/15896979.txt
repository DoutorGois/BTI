Myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) contributes to the prevention of axonal regeneration in the adult central nervous system (CNS). However, changes in MAG expression following lesions and the involvement of MAG in the failure of cortical connections to regenerate are still poorly understood. Here, we show that MAG expression is differently regulated in the entorhinal cortex (EC) and the hippocampus in response to axotomy of the perforant pathway. In the EC, MAG mRNA is transiently overexpressed by mature oligodendrocytes after lesion. In the hippocampus, MAG overexpression is accompanied by an increase in the number of MAG-expressing cells. Lastly, the participation of MAG in preventing axonal regeneration was tested in vitro, where neuraminidase treatment of axotomized entorhino-hippocampal cultures potentiates axonal regeneration. These results demonstrate that MAG expression is regulated in response to cortical axotomy, and indicate that it may limit axonal regeneration after CNS injury.
