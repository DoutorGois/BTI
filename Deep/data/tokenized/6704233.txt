The experiments examined whether decorticate rats are able to acquire a place learning strategy, as compared with a cue learning strategy, to successfully navigate from one place to another and whether the hippocampus, in the absence of the neocortex, contributes to successful performance. Decorticate rats, with or without hippocampectomy, were unable to locate an "invisible" platform submerged at a fixed place in a tank of cool water (made opaque by milk), rather they scrabbled at the edges of the tank and failed even to initiate search strategies. They were able to learn to swim directly to the platform if it was visible. Their ability to find the hidden platform was not enhanced by presurgical experience or two-stage ablations with training before and after ablations. When pretrained on the cue task and tested on the place task, they learned to inhibit scrabbling at the tank edges and "search" in a haphazard fashion for the hidden platform, but they never learned to swim directly toward it. When decorticate rats, trained on the cue task, received superior colliculus or basal ganglia removal in a second operation, cue learning was abolished. Hippocampal removal after decortication left performance on the cue task unaffected. The results demonstrate: (1) the integrity of the neocortex is essential for place learning; (2) the brainstem, including superior colliculus and basal ganglia, is sufficient for cue learning; and (3) in the absence of the neocortex the hippocampus plays no role in guiding either type of navigation. It is concluded that sensorimotor subsystems of the forebrain play a special role as detector-response systems for guiding behaviour in response to constellations of distal stimuli, whereas subcortical structures are sufficient for navigation to a single stimulus.
