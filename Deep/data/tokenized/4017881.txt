The effect of ethanol on respiratory coefficients in the isolated hepatocytes and on oxygen consumption by slices of brain regions were studied. Ethanol inhibits carbon dioxide production and the respiratory quotient in most of the assayed cases. However, oxygen consumption is apparently unaffected. When the hepatocytes were incubated for 1 h with doses of 10, 20, 40, 80 and 100 mM ethanol, the cellular viability decreased by 27, 33, 34, 48 and 67%, respectively. The effects on respiration are discussed in relation to the cellular viability. The results indicate that ethanol inhibits oxygen consumption in the hypothalamus and hippocampus. However, in the amygdala no significant differences were observed. In the cortex, a byphasic effect was observed.
