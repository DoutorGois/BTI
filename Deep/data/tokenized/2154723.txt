The agonist-induced steady-state desensitization of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor was investigated by means of whole cell patch and concentration clamp in isolated pyramidal neurons from rat hippocampus. When administered against a background of previously applied agonist, glycine (Gly) produced a response that was smaller than the response elicited by simultaneous application of agonist and Gly. This feature could be explained by an agonist-induced suppression of NMDA receptor sensitivity to the facilitatory action of Gly. This type of 'steady-state desensitization' did not develop when the preincubating solutions contained kynurenate (250 microM). It is proposed that NMDA receptors at all concentrations of agonist may acquire two distinct and interconverting conformations that are sensitive or insensitive to the facilitatory action of Gly. Kynurenate shifts the equilibrium between these states keeping the receptor in a Gly-sensitive conformation.
