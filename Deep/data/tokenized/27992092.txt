OBJECTIVES: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) has been either approved or is currently under investigation for a number of psychiatric disorders. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We review clinical and preclinical concepts as well as the neurocircuitry that may be of relevance for the implementation of DBS in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). RESULTS: PTSD is a chronic and debilitating illness associated with dysfunction in well-established neural circuits, including the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. Although most patients often improve with medications and/or psychotherapy, approximately 20-30% are considered to be refractory to conventional treatments. In other psychiatric disorders, DBS has been investigated in treatment-refractory patients. To date, preclinical work suggests that stimulation at high frequency delivered at particular timeframes to different targets, including the amygdala, ventral striatum, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex may improve fear extinction and anxiety-like behavior in rodents. In the only clinical report published so far, a patient implanted with electrodes in the amygdala has shown striking improvements in PTSD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Neuroimaging, preclinical, and preliminary clinical data suggest that the use of DBS for the treatment of PTSD may be practical but the field requires further investigation.
