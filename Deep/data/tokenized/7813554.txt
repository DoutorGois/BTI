In rats habituated to the manipulation that precedes killing (handling-habituated) the cerebral cortical concentrations of pregnenolone and progesterone were significantly lower (-57% and -69%, respectively) than in naive animals. An acute stress, induced by CO2 inhalation, elicited a marked increase in the concentrations of pregnenolone, progesterone and deoxycorticosterone in the brain cortex and hippocampus of handling-habituated rats. An accepted stress, such as foot shock, also enhanced the brain cortical levels of pregnenolone, progesterone and deoxycorticosterone in handling-habituated rats. These data show that the rat brain cortical and hippocampal steroid content is related to the 'emotional state' of the animal.
