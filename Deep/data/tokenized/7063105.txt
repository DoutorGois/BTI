The neurotoxic and convulsant properties of conformationally restricted and synthetic analogues of excitatory acidic amino acids were examined after stereotaxic injection into the striatum and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation. In the striatum, neurotoxicity was quantified by the reduction in the activity of choline acetyltransferase and glutamate decarboxylase, markers for striatal intrinsic neurons. The following sequence of neurotoxic potencies was defined; kainic acid approximately equal to domoic acid much greater than alpha-keto kainic acid approximately equal to alpha-allo kainic acid greater than ibotenic acid approximately equal to cis-cyclopentyl glutamic acid greater than quisqualic acid approximately equal to N-methyl-D-aspartic acid. When normalized for neurotoxic potencies, a wide variation in the convulsant effects of the agents was observed after hippocampal injection. N-Methyl-D-aspartate produced nearly continuous electroencephalographic seizures for 2 hr after injection, where alpha-keto-kainate and kainate and quisqualate caused seizure activity for 64 and 45% respectively of this period; kainate, alpha-allo kainate and domoate caused intermittent seizure activity during approximately 30% of the recording period; ibotenate and cyclopentylglutamate had minimal convulsant effects. Seizures were associated with a significant reduction in the levels of norepinephrine and with increases in the levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in the cortex and hippocampal formation and increases in the levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid in the hippocampal formation. Kainate, domoate, keto-kainate and alpha-allo-kainate caused extensive lesions of the hippocampal formation that also involved the pyriform cortex; ibotenate and cyclopentylglutamate caused uniform but substantial lesions limited to the dentate gyrus, whereas quisqualate and N-methyl-D-aspartate produced small and restricted lesions. The results demonstrate a poor correlation between the neurotoxic and convulsant potencies of these excitatory amino acid analogues and suggest that receptor-specific interactions may account for these disparities.
