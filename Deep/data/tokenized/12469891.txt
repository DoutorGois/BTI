Experiments on rat hippocampal slices were performed with testing of the synaptic connections of Schaffer collaterals and neurons in field CA1 to study the effects of interrupting low-frequency test stimulation (0.05 Hz) on the amplitude of population spikes. These studies demonstrated a correlation between the duration of pauses in stimulation (form 10 to 120 min) and increases in the amplitude of spikes (on average by 30-100% of baseline response magnitude). This "deprivation" potentiation was additive and could persist for long periods of time (testing was up to 1 h). Preliminary induction of long-term post-tetanic potentiation, which prevented the subsequent development of the late, but not the shortterm phase, for 1-3 h, led to suppression of the development of "deprivation" potentiation after a 60-min pause in stimulation. Similar results were obtained in experiments using 20 microM polymyxin B, which blocks protein kinase C and the PKC-dependent phase of long-term post-tetanic potentiation; this is evidence supporting the previously advanced hypothesis that the development of deprivation potentiation and the late. PKC-dependent phase of long-term post-tetanic potentiation share common mechanisms, associated with people phosphorylation.
