Fear reactions of rats given bilateral lesions to the septum, hippocampus, or amygdala were compared with those of rats given sham lesions, in 2 animal models of anxiety: the shock-probe burying test and the elevated plus-maze test. Septal lesions produced anxiolytic effects in both tests (i.e., an increase in open-arm activity and a decrease in burying), whereas hippocampal and amygdaloid lesions produced neither of these effects. On the other hand, hippocampal and amygdaloid lesions impaired rats' passive avoidance of the electrified shock-probe, whereas septal lesions did not. These dissociations suggest that limbic structures such as the septum, amygdala, and hippocampus exert parallel but distinct control over different fear reactions.
