It has been suggested that the striatum mediates hippocampus-independent memory tasks. Classical fear conditioning to a discrete stimulus such as a tone is not affected by hippocampal lesion, whereas contextual fear conditioning is an hippocampus dependent task. The purpose of the present study was to verify the effect of dorsal striatal lesions on tone and contextual fear conditioning. The lesioned rats were not impaired in contextual fear conditioning but in tone fear conditioning both electrolytically and neurotoxically lesioned animals showed less freezing compared with controls. The lesion effect was observed after a postoperative recovery period of 14 days but not after 2 months. The results support the hypothesis that the dorsal striatum is involved in hippocampus-independent memory tasks, but, in spite of this involvement, it does not seem to be a critical structure.
