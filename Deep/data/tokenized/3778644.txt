Cholinergic neurotransmission has been followed in striatum and hippocampus in two inbred strains of mice (C57Bl/6 and Balb/c) during long term alcohol exposure (over a 25 month period) and with aging. Marked strain dependent differences in reactivity of pre- and postsynaptic cholinergic markers to chronic alcohol exposure and aging were demonstrated in both structures. The Balb/c strain exhibits a remarkable long lasting tolerance to alcohol injury for striatal and hippocampal cholinergic markers (choline acetyltransferase, high affinity choline uptake, muscarinic receptors affinity, acetyl cholinesterase), whereas C57Bl mice appear more sensitive to alcohol intoxication. Likewise aging affects the C57Bl mouse more severely than the Balb/c, a phenomenon which may be involved in the sensitivity of these mice to alcohol intoxication. Moreover long term alcohol exposure, in addition to aging show unequal effects on the diverse cholinergic markers studied. Also divergences of specific brain areas have been noted and should be related to their particular neuroanatomy. Such discrepancies may, in part, explain differences observed in the behavioral effects of chronic alcohol intoxication in alcoholics.
