The neurobiology of the attribute model of memory suggests that that there are potential interactions between the hippocampus and parietal cortex (PC) during learning, consolidation, and retrieval of spatial but not nonspatial information. In addition, the model suggests that there are double dissociations between the hippocampus and PC with respect to the intrinsic processes of spatial perceptual memory and spatial short-term or working memory. Data are presented that support both suggestions. There is a good possibility that spatial information is initially processed in parallel in the hippocampus and PC, followed by transfer of spatial information from the hippocampus to the PC for subsequent long-term storage.
