Alteration in lipid peroxidation products such as lipid peroxides, lipid hydroperoxides were studied in different regions of CNS of ageing rats (13, 26, 52, 78 and 104 weeks). The levels of lipid peroxide and lipid hydroperoxide were increased in various regions of brain and spinal cord. However, the activity of superoxide dismutase was decreased in cerebrum, hypothalamus, hippocampus, cerebellum, brain stem and spinal cord. The present communication demonstrates that the different parts of CNS at 13 and 26 weeks of age have lipid peroxidation products different from that of 104-week-old rats.
