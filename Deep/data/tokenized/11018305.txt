To investigate possible functional correlates of alpha (8-15 Hz) oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG) intracranial recordings in cats (from thalamus, occipital cortex, and hippocampus) were performed. In response to visual stimuli, event-related alpha oscillations were observed. Such alpha responses were found not only in a specific sensory (visual) pathway but also in the hippocampus, hinting at a possible distributed alpha response system.
