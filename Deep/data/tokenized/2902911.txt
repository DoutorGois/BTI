The densities of specific binding sites for glutamate or its analogue kainate were determined in the hippocampi of patients having suffered of senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) and compared to age matched controls. The densities of sites were reduced in SDAT cases. These results indicate a lack of hippocampal plasticity in senile dementia of Alzheimer type.
