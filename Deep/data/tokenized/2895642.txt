The influence of long-term haloperidol pretreatment on neuronal spontaneous activity and transmitter sensitivity was investigated in prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and locus coeruleus. The changes are different in all areas as well as in the transmission systems involved. In particular cases, analogies exist between haloperidol- and isolation-induced changes, reflecting a comparable dopaminergic supersensitivity.
