Neuronal tumors, such as gangliocytoma/gangliogliomas and cerebral neurocytomas, are slow-growing, indolent tumors consiting of neoplastic neuronal cells. They are likely to be present with seizures, often medically intractable epilepsy. During surgery for neuronal tumors associated intractable epilepsy, an enlargement of a resection area beyond the tumor boundaries, with recordings of intraoperative and/or chronic electrocorticography, may improve the postoperative seizure outcome, since tumor surrounding areas may have 'cerebral microdysgenesis' and may thus be epileptogenic. In addition, when the mesiotemporal lobe structures are involved with the tumor on the neuroimaging and have epileptiform electrocorticography activities, tumor removal and additional removal of the hippocampus are recommended.
