The results are given of in vivo experiments on the binding of (3H)aldosterone to corticosteroid receptors of the cytoplasm and nuclei in the brain structure in rats with different types of behavior. Differences were established in binding (3H)aldosterone to corticosteroid receptors of the hippocampus cytoplasm in the animals with different types of behavior both under the normal conditions and within two weeks after stress. Stress was shown to affect the binding of this hormone to corticosteroid receptors of the brain cytoplasm (without hippocampus and cerebellum). No differences were found in the binding of aldosterone to corticosteroid receptors of the brain nuclei after stress.
