In the present work, X-ray fluorescence microscopy with a synchrotron source for the exciting radiation was applied for topographic and quantitative elemental analysis of rat brain tissue in pilocarpine-induced epilepsy and neuroprotection with FK-506. The mass per unit area of the elements P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Fe, Cu, Zn, Se, Br, and Rb was determined in four fields of the hippocampal formation (sectors 1 and 3 of Ammon's horn-CA1, CA3; dentate gyrus; hilus of dentate gyrus) and the parietal cortex. The results obtained for epileptic rats treated with FK-506 (SNF) were compared with data obtained previously for epileptic rats (SNS) and a control group. Many statistically significant differences in elemental composition were observed between the SNF and SNS groups. Higher mass per unit area of P was noticed in CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus of SNF rats in comparison with SNS rats. A similar relation was observed for K in all five brain areas analyzed. Also, Fe in CA3 and dentate gyrus, Cu in the parietal cortex, and Zn in CA3 and in the cortex were present at a higher level in the SNF group in comparison with the SNS group. The findings obtained in the present study suggest that the neuroprotective action of FK-506 in epileptic rat brain may involve not only the inhibition of calcineurin but also blockade of the K(+) channels.
