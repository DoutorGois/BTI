Regional localization of neurotransmitter system receptors was visualized in the gerbil grain and in the rat brain using receptor autoradiography. [3H]Quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB), [3H]cyclohexyladenosine (CHA), [3H]muscimol, [3H]MK-801, [3H]SCH 23390, [3H]PN200-110, [3H]spiperone, and [3H]naloxone were label muscarinic receptors, adenosine A1 receptors, GABAA receptors, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, dopamine D1 receptors, L-type calcium channels, spirodecanone receptors, and opioid receptors, respectively. Regional localization of [3H]QNB, [3H]muscimol, [3H]MK-801, [3H]SCH 23390, and [3H]PN200-110 binding sites in the gerbil brain was relatively similar to that in the rat brain. In contrast, the autoradiographic distribution of [3H]spiperone and [3H]naloxone binding sites in the gerbil was quite different from that in the rat. This phenomenon was found especially in the hippocampus and the cerebellum. The results suggest that the gerbil differs from the rat with respect to spirodecanone and opioid binding sites in the hippocampus and the cerebellum. This finding may help to further elucidate the species differences and relationships for brain function and behavioral pharmacology.
