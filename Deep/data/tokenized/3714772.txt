A significant decrease in catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) activity has been found in the striatum (77% of control) and hippocampus (63% of control) of gerbils treated with daily injections of beta-phenylethylamine (50 mg/kg) for 10 days. This treatment group also exhibited increased (204% above control) COMT activity in a lysed red blood cell preparation. There were no changes in COMT activity in groups receiving 10 mg/kg beta-phenylethylamine or haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg). In vitro beta-phenylethylamine has no demonstrable effect on COMT activity.
