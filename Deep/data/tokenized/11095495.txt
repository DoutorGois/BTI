Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) acts through the JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway. However, the rapid action of CNTF cannot readily be explained by reference to this pathway. Using the fluorophore, Fura 2-AM, and fluorescence imaging, the effect of CNTF on glutamate-induced increases in hippocampal intraneuronal free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) was investigated. Glutamate induces a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i. Incubation of hippocampal neurons with CNTF for 5 min inhibited the glutamate-induced increase in [Ca2+]i. In the absence of glutamate, CNTF had no effect on [Ca2+]i. Pertussis toxin (PTX), a G-protein antagonist, partially blocked the effect of CNTF. This suggests that CNTF may act via an alternative signal transduction pathway besides the generic JAK/STAT pathway.
