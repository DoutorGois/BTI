The present experiments were performed to study the binding characteristics of delta opioid receptors in membrane preparations obtained from the brain of adult male rats, and to analyze whether aging modifies these binding parameters. The binding characteristics of delta opioid receptors were evaluated on membrane preparations derived from dissected brain regions (hypothalamus, amygdala, mesencephalon, corpus striatum, hippocampus, thalamus, frontal poles, anterior and posterior cortex) collected from male rats of 3 and 24 months of age; the highly selective ligand 3H-[D-Pen2-D-Pen5] enkephalin (3H-DPDPE) was used. The results obtained in young rats show that the distribution of delta opioid receptors is different in the various brain areas examined; these receptors appear to be maximally concentrated in the frontal poles, anterior and posterior cortex; lower concentrations were found in the other structures considered. Kd (dissociation constant) for the delta sites was found very similar in all areas. The distribution of delta opioid receptors in the brain of 24-month-old rats was similar to that observed in young animals; this result was surprising in view of the fact that aging modifies the number of other types of brain opioid receptors (mu and kappa).
