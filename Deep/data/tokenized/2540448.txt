The development of long-term potentiation (LTP), an enduring alteration in synaptic efficacy following afferent activation, was examined in CA1 hippocampus and primary visual cortex of rat. Both regions show little LTP prior to postnatal day 5, demonstrate a maximal potentiated response around postnatal day 15, and a subsequent decline to adult levels. These results are discussed with respect to the underlying mechanism of action and behavioral significance of these critical-period phenomena.
