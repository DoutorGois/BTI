We have demonstrated that ischemic neuronal death (apoptosis) of rat CA1 region of the hippocampus was prevented by infusing pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) either intracerebroventricularly or intravenously. We have also demonstrated that the activity of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family members, including ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) and p38, was increased in the hippocampus within 1-6 h after brain ischemia. The molecular mechanisms underlying the PACAP anti-apoptotic effect were demonstrated in this study. Ischemic stress had a strong influence on MAP kinase family, especially on JNK/SAPK and p38. PACAP inhibited the activation of JNK/SAPK and p38 after ischemic stress, while ERK is not suppressed. These findings suggest that PACAP inhibits the JNK/SAPK and p38 signaling pathways, thereby protecting neurons against apoptosis.
