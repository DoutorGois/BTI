Intranasal administration of the polypeptide APHC3, an antagonist of the TRPV1 receptor, had acute anxiolytic and antidepressant effects, as well as an ability to modify the microglial response to proinflammatory stress and cytokine profile of the hippocampus. However, the acute antidepressant effect of the polypeptide was not related to the attenuation of neuroiflammation and probably had a different mechanism. The use of intranasal administration of the APHC3 peptide as a therapeutic approach aimed at decreasing depression symptoms needs additional studies in order to find the mechanism of action of this polypeptide in the central nervous system (CNS).
