Migration disorders cause neurons to differentiate in an abnormal heterotopic position. Although significant insights have been gained into the etiology of these disorders, very little is known about the anatomy of heterotopias. We have studied heterotopic masses arising in the hippocampal CA1 region after prenatal treatment with methylazoxymethanol (MAM) in rats. Heterotopic cells were phenotypically similar to neocortical supragranular neurons and exhibited the same temporal profile of migration and neurogenesis. However, they did not express molecules characteristic of CA1 neurons such as the limbic-associated membrane protein. Horseradish peroxidase injections in heterotopia demonstrated labeled fibers not only in the neocortex and white matter but also in the CA1 stratum radiatum and stratum lacunosum. To study the pathophysiological consequences of this connectivity, we compared the effects of neocortical and limbic seizures on the expression of Fos protein and on cell death in MAM animals. After metrazol-induced seizures, Fos-positive cells were present in CA1 heterotopias, the only hippocampal region to be activated with the neocortex. By contrast, kainic acid-induced seizures caused a prominent delayed cell death in limbic regions and in CA1 heterotopias. Together, these results suggest that neocortical heterotopias in the CA1 region are integrated in both the hippocampal and neocortical circuitry.
