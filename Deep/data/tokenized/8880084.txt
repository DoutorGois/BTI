Based on animal studies it has been reasoned that ligands to sigma binding sites might be effective in the treatment of schizophrenic disorders and may also be used to investigate this largely elusive disorder on a molecular level. Expression patterns of c-fos in rat brain were studied following treatment with single doses of the sigma ligand EMD 57445 (0.3, 1, 3, 30 mg/kg s.c.). Specific c-fos gene expression was detected at all concentrations tested in various cortical areas. The signals observed were dose-dependent with the highest intensities in the piriform cortex. Strong signals were also detected in hippocampal areas CA 1,2,3 and the gyrus dentatus, as well as in the medial habenula nuclei. In the caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens and lateral septal nucleus signals were detectable after administration of doses > or = 1 mg/kg. Furthermore, c-fos hybridization was visible in the amygdala, in the mammillary bodies, the islands of Calleja and in the olfactory tubercle. In the hypothalamus, c-fos expression was seen in the median eminence area after 30 mg/kg EMD 57445. No hybridization signals were obtained in brainstem or cerebellum. Since c-fos expression induced by EMD 57445 resembled the pattern obtained with atypical neuroleptics and studies on animal behavior point to antipsychotic activity, it is concluded that the drug might be suitable in the treatment of schizophrenia.
