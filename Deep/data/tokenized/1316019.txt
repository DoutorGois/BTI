In experiments on 6 dogs it has been shown that in the EPs led from the hippocampus in response to electrostimulation of limbic structures and from the latters at the hippocampus stimulation, initial negativity, after positivity and late negative wave are the most stable components. At transition from one functional state to another two latter waves are subjected to the greatest changes. Amplitude-temporal characteristics of intralimbic EPs depend on the level and type of motivation, degree of emotional stress and properties of conditioned reaction.
