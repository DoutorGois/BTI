Perinatal phencyclidine (PCP) administration to rats represents one of the actual animal models of schizophrenia. Numerous data suggest redox dysregulation in this disease. We have previously demonstrated decreased content of the reduced glutathione (GSH) and complex disbalance of antioxidant enzymes in the brain of rats perinatally treated with PCP. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether chronic risperidone treatment can reverse these changes. The Wistar rats were perinatally treated with either PCP (10mg/kg; PCP, two groups) or saline (0.9% NaCl, two groups). At postnatal day (PN) 35, two groups of rats one NaCl and one PCP have started to receive risperidone in drinking water for nine weeks (NaCl-RSP and PCP-RSP groups). Animals were sacrificed on PN100 and the levels of GSH, the activities of gamma-glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), as well as, the concentration of lipid peroxides were determined in the different brain structures. Risperidone restored decreased GSH levels, as well as decreased gamma-GCL activity in cortex and hippocampus of animals perinatally treated with PCP. Alterations in GPx and GR activities caused by perinatal PCP treatment were also reversed by risperidone in most investigated brain structures. Furthermore, chronic risperidone treatment caused the decrease in SOD activity both in control and in PCP perinatally treated groups. Increased levels of lipid peroxides noticed in hippocampus and thalamus were reversed after chronic risperidone treatment. The results of the present study demonstrate that risperidone treatment restores GSH levels and to great measure reverses antioxidant defense alterations in the brain of perinatally PCP treated rats. Further studies are necessary in order to clarify the significance of risperidone influence on oxidative stress parameters in schizophrenia.
