Retrogradely labeled cells were found in field CA1 of the hippocampal formation in monkeys following injections of horseradish peroxidase in ventral area TE of inferotemporal cortex. No hippocampal label was found following injections in dorsal area TE and area TEO. The findings provide the first demonstration of a direct projection from hippocampal field CA1 to area TE.
