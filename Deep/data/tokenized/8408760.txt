Previous work has associated the proto-oncogene c-fos with such events as neuronal excitation and cell growth and differentiation. This study specifically examined the expression of the Fos protein as well as other Fos-related antigens (Fras) during postnatal development of rat brain. Ages P1 through P15 as well as adult animals (P60) were examined. Particular focus was placed on developing cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum. We used both the Alu antiserum, which recognizes the Fos protein specifically, and the M5 antiserum, which recognizes both Fos and a family of Fos-related antigens. Fos and Fras were developmentally regulated in a region- and cell-specific manner. Differential nuclear and cytoplasmic labeling appeared age dependent. Transient Fos expression was generally followed by a more protracted time course of Fra expression. Fos and a delayed or an extended expression of Fras were observed in subplate neurons between P1 and P15, in striatal striosome and matrix neurons between P1 and P9, and in hippocampal pyramidal neurons between P1 and P9. Fras alone were expressed in cerebral cortex pyramidal neurons and other cortical neurons between ages P1 and P15. Fos and Fras were concomitantly expressed in piriform and entorhinal cortical neurons between P1 and P9 and in cerebellar Purkinje cells between ages P5 and P10. Constitutive levels of Fos and Fras remained detectable in adult animals in a subset of cerebral cortical neurons and cerebellar Purkinje neurons.
