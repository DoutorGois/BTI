Testosterone, acting through its androgenic metabolite 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), can increase dendritic spine density in the CA1 region of the male rat hippocampus. The mechanisms mediating this increase in spines are presently unknown. In female rats, estrogen (E) has been shown to increase spine density, which is in part mediated by increases in N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the CA1 region and cholinergic forebrain inputs to the hippocampus. Whether similar mechanisms are responsible for the DHT-induced increase in spines in the male remains to be determined. In the first experiment, we used [(3)H]glutamate NMDA receptor binding autoradiography to assess whether DHT-treated males had higher NMDA receptor levels in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, compared with oil-treated males. In the second set of experiments, we used choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry to assess whether DHT could affect ChAT cell number in the forebrain. We also investigated the effect of DHT on hemicholinium-3-sensitive choline transporter levels in the CA1 region of the male hippocampus. We found that DHT significantly increased NMDA receptor binding in the CA1 region of males but had no effect on ChAT cell number in the forebrain or hemicholinium-3-sensitive choline transporter protein levels in the CA1 region. These data indicate that, similar to E-induced spinogenesis in females, DHT-induced increases in spine formation in males may require increases in NMDA receptors. However, unlike E-treated females, these data suggest that DHT does not influence cholinergic inputs to the hippocampus.
