In the present study, we focused upon expression and changes of endogenous insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in the hippocampus of the Mongolian gerbil after ischemic insult. In sham-operated animals, IGF-1 immunoreactivity was absent from the hippocampus. IGF-1-immunoreactive (IR) neurons were detected at 12 h and 1 day after ischemic insult. In the hippocampal CA1 area, the IGF-IR neurons were non-pyramidal cells (GABAergic neurons). In the hippocampal CA2/3 areas, the IGF-1-IR neurons were pyramidal and non-pyramidal cells, and in the dentate gyrus the IGF-1-IR neurons were hilar neurons. Four days after ischemia-reperfusion, IGF-1 immunoreactivity disappeared from neurons, and significantly increased in astrocytes and microglia. These results suggest that the induction of IGF-1 in the CA1 area during the early stage (12-24 h after ischemic insult) is associated with the relative vulnerabilities of pyramidal glutamatergic neurons and non-pyramidal GABAergic neurons. The later increase (4 days after ischemic insult) of IGF-1 expression and protein content was found to promote the activities of astrocytes and microglia. These increases of IGF-1 in astrocytes and in microglia are associated with mechanisms that compensate for the effects of delayed neuronal death.
