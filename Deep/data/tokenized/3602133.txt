Retention of reference memory was evaluated in an animal model of cerebral ischemia. Rats were trained for 70 daily trials on an 8-arm radial maze with 5 arms baited, subjected to 30 minutes of forebrain ischemia, allowed to recover for 30 days, and then tested for an additional 50 trials. Post ischemic (PI) rats demonstrated normal retention of reference memory (p less than 0.05). Working memory was significantly impaired postoperatively (p less than 0.05). Morphologic analysis showed that PI rats had primary loss of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region of hippocampus.
