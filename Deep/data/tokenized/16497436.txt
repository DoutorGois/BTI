In our previous studies, pathophysiological concentrations of amyloid-beta (Abeta) proteins increased intracellular Cl(-) concentration ([Cl(-)]i) and enhanced glutamate neurotoxicity in primary cultured neurons, suggesting Cl(-)-dependent changes in glutamate signaling. To test this possibility, we examined the effects of isethionate-replaced low Cl(-) medium on the Abeta-induced enhancement of glutamate neurotoxicity in the primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons. In a normal Cl(-) (135 mM) medium, treatment with 10 nM Abeta25-35 for 2 days increased neuronal [Cl(-)]i to a level three times higher than that of control as assayed using a Cl(-)-sensitive fluorescent dye, while in a low Cl(-) (16 mM) medium such an Abeta25-35-induced increase in [Cl(-)]i was not observed. The Abeta treatment aggravated glutamate neurotoxicity in a normal Cl(-) medium as measured by mitochondrial reducing activity and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, while in a low Cl(-) medium the Abeta treatment did not enhance glutamate toxicity. Upon such Abeta plus glutamate treatment under a normal Cl(-) condition, activated anti-apoptotic molecule Akt (Akt-pS473) level monitored by Western blot significantly decreased to 74% of control. Under a low Cl(-) condition, a resting Akt-pS473 level was higher than that under a normal Cl(-) condition and did not significantly change upon Abeta plus glutamate treatment. Tyrosine phosphorylation levels of 110 and 60 kDa proteins (pp110 and pp60) increased upon Abeta plus glutamate treatment under a normal Cl(-), but not low Cl(-), condition. These findings indicated that Abeta-induced enhancement of glutamate neurotoxicity is Cl(-)-dependent. Chloride-sensitive Akt pathway and tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins (pp110 and pp60) may be involved in this process.
