Glutamate and its receptors represent the major excitatory neurotransmission system in the mammalian brain and are considered important in the pathogenesis of many neurological diseases. The present study describes saturation binding experiments performed to measure the affinity (Kd) and density (Bmax) of kainate and AMPA receptors in striatum, cortex and hippocampus from mature DBA/2J (DBA) and C57BL/6J (C57) mice. Previous studies have documented that these two strains differ significantly in seizure susceptibility, with DBA mice exhibiting greater sensitivity in various convulsant tests compared to C57 mice. Non-linear regression analysis of binding data together with Student's t-test and ANOVA revealed significantly higher densities of kainate receptors in striatum and of AMPA receptors in cortex of DBA mice. C57 mice exhibited higher striatal [3H]AMPA binding. There were no significant differences between the mouse strains in binding sites prepared from hippocampus and no differences in affinity for either receptor in any brain region studied. The results support a role for kainate and AMPA receptors in seizure sensitivity, possibly by influencing glutamate transmission in specific pathways. It is unlikely, however, that these receptors account for the generation of seizures alone but rather cooperate with other glutamatergic and non-glutamatergic neurotransmitter systems.
