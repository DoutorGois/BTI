Effects of S-adenosyl-L-methionine on Ca accumulation as well as the changes of electrolytes contents and glucose metabolism after transient ischemia were investigated. In the 4-vessel occlusion model of rats, brain Ca content increased to 200-250% of that in sham operated rats 1 day after 60 min transient ischemia. The change in the striatum was more severe than that in the cortex or hippocampus. Na content increased and K content decreased, and glucose, pyruvate and lactate contents increased significantly in the striatum 1 day after transient ischemia. SAM (100 mg/kg, i.p.) was injected at the end of occlusion and every hour for 5 hr thereafter. Treatment with SAM reduced Ca accumulation, decrease of K, and increase of lactate and pyruvate in the striatum significantly. The present results suggest that the inhibition of Ca accumulation might partly explain the beneficial effects of SAM on the cerebral dysfunction following ischemia.
