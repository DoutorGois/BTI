Nervous system development is a precisely orchestrated series of events requiring a multitude of intrinsic and extrinsic cues. Sortilin and SorCS2 are members of the Vps10p receptor family with complementary influence on some of these cues including the neurotrophins (NTs). However, the developmental time points where sortilin and SorCS2 exert their activities in conjunction or independently still remain unclear. In this study we present the characterization of the spatiotemporal expression pattern of sortilin and SorCS2 in the developing murine nervous system. Sortilin is highly expressed in the fetal nervous system with expression localized to distinct cell populations. Expression was high in neurons of the cortical plate and developing allocortex, as well as subpallial structures. Furthermore, the neuroepithelium lining the ventricles and the choroid plexus showed high expression of sortilin, together with the developing retina, spinal ganglia, and sympathetic ganglia. In contrast, SorCS2 was confined in a marked degree to the thalamus and, at E13.5, the floor plate from midbrain rostrally to spinal cord caudally. SorCS2 was also found in the ventricular zones of the ventral hippocampus and nucleus accumbens areas, in the meninges and in Schwann cells. Hence, sortilin and SorCS2 are extensively present in several distinct anatomical areas in the developing nervous system and are rarely co-expressed. Possible functions of sortilin and SorCS2 pertain to NT signaling, axon guidance and beyond. The present data will form the basis for hypotheses and study designs for unravelling the functions of sortilin and SorCS2 during the establishment of neuronal structures and connections.
