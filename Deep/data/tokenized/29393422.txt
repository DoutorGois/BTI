Preclinical studies suggest that propofol may cause neuronal injury to the developing brain. A previous study demonstrated that, in a rat model, maternal exposure to propofol during early or late pregnancy caused learning and memory impairment in the offspring. However, whether propofol exposure during middle pregnancy can cause longterm behavioral deficits in the offspring remains to be elucidated. NmethylDaspartate receptor 2B subunit (NR2B) serves a critical role in memory modulation. To exert its function, NR2B must be transported to the neuronal membrane by kinesin family member 17 (KIF17). The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of KIF17 in learning and memory impairment in rat offspring caused by propofol exposure during middle pregnancy. Pregnant rats were exposed to propofol on gestational day 14 (G14) for 4 and 8 h, with control pregnant rats receiving an equal volume of normal saline. The learning and memory of the offspring was assessed using Morris water maze tests from postnatal day 30 (P30) to P36. The levels of KIF17 protein, total NR2B (TNR2B) and membrane NR2B (MNR2B) in the hippocampus were detected using western blotting. The results demonstrated that propofol exposure caused learning and memory deficits and decreased KIF17 and MNR2B protein levels in the hippocampus; however, no but changes in the expression of TNR2B were observed. These results indicate that maternal propofol exposure during middle pregnancy impairs learning and memory in offspring rats by suppressing the expression of KIF17 and inhibiting the translocation of NR2B to the neuronal membrane.
