The contributions of (+/-)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA[A]) receptors in the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) have been studied in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus. The results suggest that: (1) in physiological conditions, AMPARs are necessary for the induction of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent LTP since LTP cannot be elicited in the presence of the AMPAR antagonist, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX). Although a NMDAR-dependent LTP occurs in the presence of a GABA(A) antagonist and high concentrations of divalents cations, blockade of AMPARs leads to a voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCC)-dependent LTP since its induction is blocked by nifedipine and not by APV. (2) The bicarbonate-induced GABA(A) receptor-mediated depolarizing response is not necessary in the induction of NMDAR-dependent or VDCC-dependent LTP since induction of these two types of LTP were not blocked by acetazolamide or in a nominally bicarbonate-free solution.
