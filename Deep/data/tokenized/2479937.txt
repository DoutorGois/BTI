Ipsapirone (TVX Q 7821), a compound with a high affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor-subtype, decreased by itself 5-HIAA level and reduced 5-HIAA accumulation after probenecid administration in the rat hypothalamus. The reduced 5-HIAA level and 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio after the 5-HT1A selective agonist 8-OH-DPAT was not antagonized by pretreatment with ipsapirone.
