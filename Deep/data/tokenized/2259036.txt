Temporal lobe epilepsy with amygdalohippocampal seizures may have episodes of severe convulsions in childhood more frequently and the onset age is significantly lower compared to epilepsy with lateral temporal seizures. To the contrary, tumorous lesions are found more frequently in epilepsy with lateral temporal seizures. In view of the presumed known etiologies in relation to the localization of epileptogenic foci, the Classification of Epileptic Syndrome (1989), subdividing temporal lobe epilepsies into 2 groups, was found to be useful.
