The aim of this study was to evaluate the pathogenicity of Vibrio alginolyticus isolated from an outbreak of sea horse Hippocampus reidi reared in the State of Santa Catarina, Brazil, by experimental infection. Sea horses with necrosis on the mouth epithelium were collected from aquaria at the Aquaculture Department, UFSC and the bacterium isolated from the mouth, liver, heart and blood in thiosulphate citrate bilesalt sucrose agar broth. The strains were identified by API 20E kit with 99.1% probability as Vibrio alginolyticus. Twelve adult sea horses (9.63 +/- 2.42 g and 15.12 +/- 0.87 cm) were distributed in six aquaria of 10 L capacity with aerated sea water. Fish from three aquaria were submitted to an immersion bath in a solution containing 1.0 x 10(7) CFU of V. alginolyticus/mL for 15 minutes. Fish from the other three aquaria received the same procedure without bacteria. Twenty four hours after this challenge, 100% mortality was observed in the animals infected with V. alginolyticus. No mortality was observed in non-infected fish. Hyperplasia, displacement and fusion of secondary lamellae of the gills; leukocyte infiltration and necrotic foci in the kidney; hyperplasia, sinusoidal deformation and necrotic foci in the liver were observed in histopathological analysis. The V. alginolyticus isolated in this study was pathogenic to H. reidi and constitutes an important sanitary problem to its culture.
