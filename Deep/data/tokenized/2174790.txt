A cDNA clone which encodes a putative kainate receptor was prepared with the polymerase chain reaction; from this, 'antisense' RNA fragments were produced and used to evaluate the distribution of mRNA for the kainate-receptor in rat brain with in situ hybridization techniques. The data demonstrate marked regional differences in the abundance of kainate receptor mRNA with highest levels present in the granule and pyramidal cell layers of hippocampus, the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, and all cell layers of the olfactory bulb.
