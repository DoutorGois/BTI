A defining characteristic of diverse stem cell populations is their distinct metabolic state, although how these states change during adult hippocampal neurogenesis is unclear. Recently in Neuron, Beckervordersandforth et al. (2017) report that adult neurogenesis requires mitochondrial electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation and that disrupting these pathways induces premature aging phenotypes.
