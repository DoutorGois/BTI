Field potentials were recorded from dendritic and cell body layers of CA1 and dentate regions in newborn rabbits. Responses were evoked by electrical stimulation of the collateral Schaffer system and the perforant path with paired (a 15-100 ms interstimulus interval) and rhythmical stimuli (20-40/c, 3-5 s). Short-term potentiation in the tests with paired stimulation and posttetanic potentiation (up to 3 h) were observed in the CA1 area beginning from the first postnatal day and in the later maturing fascia dentata beginning from 8-10th days, i.e. when neuronal reactions to stimulation of the appropriate afferent pathways first appeared.
