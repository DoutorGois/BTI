Depressive disorders have complex and multi-faceted underlying mechanisms, rendering these disorders difficult to treat consistently and effectively. One under-explored therapeutic strategy for alleviating mood disorders is the targeting of microRNAs (miRs). miRs are small non-coding RNAs that cause sequestration/degradation of specific mRNAs, thereby preventing protein translation and downstream functions. miR-155 has validated and predicted neurotrophic factor and inflammatory mRNA targets, which led to our hypothesis that miR-155 deletion would modulate affective behaviors. To evaluate anxiety-like behavior, wildtype (wt) and miR-155 knockout (ko) mice (littermates; both male and female) were assessed in the open field and on an elevated plus maze. In both tests, miR-155 ko mice spent more time in open areas, suggesting they had reduced anxiety-like behavior. Depressive-like behaviors were assessed using the forced swim test. Compared to wt mice, miR-155 ko mice exhibited reduced float duration and increased latency to float. Further, although all mice exhibited a strong preference for a sucrose solution over water, this preference was enhanced in miR-155 ko mice. miR-155 ko mice had no deficiencies in learning and memory (Barnes maze) or social preference/novelty suggesting that changes in mood were specific. Finally, compared to wt hippocampi, miR-155 ko hippocampi had a reduced inflammatory signature (e.g., decreased IL-6, TNF-a) and female miR-155 ko mice increased ciliary neurotrophic factor expression. Together, these data highlight the importance of studying microRNAs in the context of anxiety and depression and identify miR-155 as a novel potential therapeutic target for improving mood disorders.
