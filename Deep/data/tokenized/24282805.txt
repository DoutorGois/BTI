Perinatal hypoxic ischemia injury is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in neonates. Physical exercise may ameliorate neurological impairment by impeding neuronal loss following various brain insults. In the present study, the effect of treadmill exercise on sensory-motor function in relation with hippocampal apoptosis following hypoxic ischemia brain injury was investigated. Sensory-motor function was determined by walking initiation test and apoptosis was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining and caspase-3 immunohistochemistry. On postnatal 7 day, left common carotid artery of the neonatal rats was ligated for two hours and then the neonatal rats were exposed to hypoxia conditions for one hour. The rat pups in the exercise groups were forced to run on a motorized treadmill for 30 min once a day for 10 days, starting 22 days after induction of hypoxic ischemia brain injury. Hypoxic ischemia caused sensory-motor disturbance with enhancement of apoptosis in the hippocampus. Short-term treadmill exercise suppressed hypoxic ischemia injury-induced apoptosis in the hippocampus, and preserved sensory-motor function of hypoxic ischemia injury rat pups.
