The pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP) family (also known as the regenerating gene (Reg) family) is a group of 16 kDa secretory proteins structurally classified as the calcium dependent-type lectin superfamily. Some PAP family members are expressed in neurons following peripheral nerve injury and traumatic brain injury. To determine whether PAP family members are expressed in non-traumatic brain injury, expressions were analyzed following kainic acid (KA)-induced seizure. PAP-I (also known as Reg2 in rat and RegIII-beta in mouse) and pancreatitis associated protein-III (PAP-III; RegIII-gamma in mouse) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) was transiently expressed in some restricted areas, such as the hippocampus and parahippocampal area; expression was observed immediately at a maximal level 1 day after seizure. Expression disappeared within 3 days after seizure. In situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry revealed neuronal PAP-I and PAP-III expression in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, perirhinal and entorhinal cortices, and the posterior cortical nucleus of the amygdala. The number of PAP-III mRNA-positive neurons was significantly greater than PAP-I mRNA-positive neurons. The majority of positive neurons co-localized with c-Jun, but not with glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). These results may suggest that PAP-I and PAP-III induction in non-GABAergic neurons would protect neurons against damage following seizure.
