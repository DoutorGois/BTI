Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of epilepsy in adults and the most resistant type to treatment. Novel treatment approaches are strongly required to prevent or even reverse the cellular and molecular mechanisms of epileptogenesis. In this study, we investigated the possible neuroprotective effect of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) in an intrahippocampal kainate model of TLE in rat. Kainate injection caused a higher seizure severity during status epilepticus and spontaneous seizure phases, and CoQ10 pretreatment significantly attenuated its severity and incidence rate. Intrahippocampal kainate also led to elevation of malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitrite, and CoQ10 significantly attenuated the increased MDA and nitrite content. In addition, intrahippocampal kainate induced a significant degeneration of neurons in CA1, CA3, and hilar regions of the hippocampus, and CoQ10 significantly attenuated these changes in CA1 and CA3 regions. Timm's staining data showed a robust mossy fiber sprouting (MFS) in dentate gyrus of kainate-lesioned rats and CoQ10 significantly lowered MFS intensity. These data suggest that CoQ10 pretreatment could attenuate spontaneous recurrent seizures and inhibit hippocampal neuronal loss and aberrant MFS in kainate-induced model of TLE in rat, and part of its beneficial effect is due to its potential to mitigate oxidative stress.
