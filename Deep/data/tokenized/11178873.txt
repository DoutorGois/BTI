XIAP (X-chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein) is an antiapoptotic protein which inhibits the activity of caspases and suppresses cell death. However, little is known about the presence and function of XIAP in the nervous system. Here we report that XIAP mRNA is expressed in developing and adult rat brain. Using a specific antibody, we observed XIAP-immunoreactive cells in different brain regions, among others, in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Kainic acid, which induces delayed cell death of specific neurons, increased the levels of XIAP in the CA3 region of hippocampus. XIAP was, however, largely absent in cells undergoing cell death, as shown by TUNEL labeling and staining for active caspase-3. In cultured hippocampal neurons, XIAP was initially upregulated by kainic acid and then degraded in a process blocked by the caspase-3 inhibitor DEVD. Similarly, recombinant XIAP is cleaved by active caspase-3 in vitro. The results show that there is biphasic regulation of XIAP in the hippocampus following kainic acid and that XIAP becomes a target for caspase-3 activated during cell death in the hippocampus. The degradation of XIAP by kainic acid contributes to neuronal cell death observed in vulnerable neurons of the hippocampus after caspase activation.
