Because it appears that oxidative stress and inflammation are implicated with disease pathogenesis in the diabetic brain, many researchers have used streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic animals to study superoxide production and the effects of superoxide scavengers like Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1). However, many studies have been conducted without considering temporal changes after STZ injection. Interestingly, though SOD activities were not significantly different among the groups, SOD1 and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) immunoreactivities were significantly enhanced at 3 weeks after an STZ injection (STZ3w) versus only marginal levels in sham controls, whereas microglial activity was remarkably reduced in injected rats at this time. However, SOD1 immunoreactivity and microglial activities were only at the sham level at STZ4w. The present study provides important information concerning cell damage by ROS generated by STZ. Microglial response was found to be inactivated at STZ3w and neuronal cells (NeuN) showed a non-significant tendency to be reduced in number at STZ4w except in the dentate gyrus. We speculated that the above oxidative stress-related events should be accomplished at STZ3w in the brains of STZ-induced diabetes animal models. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate chronological changes in SOD1 immunoreactivity associated with lipid peroxidation and inflammatory responses in the hippocampi of STZ-induced type I diabetic rats.
