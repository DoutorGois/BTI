Patient selection for temporal lobectomy was reviewed for 23 patients with seizures that arose independently from each temporal lobe as detected by depth electroencephalography (EEG). Although neuropsychological testing, interictal EEG findings, imaging studies, and subclinical seizures were also considered, all patients offered temporal lobectomy had (1) at least 50% of the clinical seizures originating from the lobe to be resected, (2) adequate contralateral memory on testing with amobarbital, and (3) no clear evidence of an extratemporal focus. Eleven patients underwent temporal lobectomy. Pathological findings were considered positive in all nine specimens reviewed. Nine patients had no seizures, one had greater than 75% reduction in seizure frequency, and 1 had 50 to 75% reduction. Pathological features and clinical outcome were similar in the 6 patients with fewer than 80% and the 5 patients with at least 80% of seizures originating from the resected lobe. Thus, having fewer than 80% of seizures originate from one temporal lobe should not be an absolute contraindication for temporal lobectomy.
