Trimethyltin has been reported to produce morphological alterations in the brain which are primarily restricted to the limbic system. A variety of physiological measures of limbic system integrity are discussed in terms of their ability to detect TMT-induced dysfunction. In addition, several measures of sensory dysfunction are discussed. It is concluded that limbic system dysfunction induced by this compound is detected more efficiently by intrahippocampal evoked potentials than by more gross measures of dysfunction. It is also concluded that relying upon preliminary descriptions of pathological alterations to direct physiological studies may provide an incomplete description of neurotoxicity.
