A 24-year-old male of medial temporal lobe epilepsy associated with schizencephaly was presented. He developed complex partial seizure after head trauma at the age of a year and 7 months, which became intractable at the age of 13 year. MRI demonstrated a schizencephalic cleft in the right peri-Rolandic area, cortical dysplasia in the right medical parietal and occipital lobes, and right hippocampal atrophy. Scalp-recorded EEG failed to localize the ictal onset zone. Interictal FDG-PET and ECD-SPECT indicated hypometabolism and hypoperfusion of the right entire temporal lobe, and ictal ECD-SPECT increased perfusion of this area. Chronic subdural electrode recording clearly demonstrated that ictal onset zone was located not on the schizencephalic cleft or its surrounding cortex but on the right medial temporal lobe. Following right anterior temporal lobectomy with hipppocampectomy, seizure control became easy. For the identification of the epileptogenic zone in patients with schizencephaly, chronic subdural electrode recording is mandatory.
