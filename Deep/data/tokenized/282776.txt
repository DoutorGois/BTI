The evidence that the brain possesses specific receptors for benzodiazepines is summarized. Further we present a series of brain lesion experiments in rats showing that specific neuronal destructions by 6-hydroxydopamine, kainic acid in the striatum, X-ray irradiation of the hippocampus, intraperitoneal 3-acetyl-pyridine or hemisection at the thalamic level do not reduce the level of benzodiazepine receptors in striatum, hippocampus, cortex or cerebellum. These results show that the benzodiazepines are not positioned on dopamine or noradrenaline terminals, cholergic or GABA-ergic neurons in the striatum, granular cells in the hippocampus or climbing fibers in the cerebellum.
