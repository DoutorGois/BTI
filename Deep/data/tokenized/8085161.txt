The organization of the hippocampus is generally thought of as a series of cell groups that form a unidirectionally excited chain, regulated by localized inhibitory circuits. With the use of in vivo intracellular labeling, histochemical, and extracellular tracing methods, a longitudinally widespread, inhibitory feedback in rat brain from the CA1 area to the CA3 and hilar regions was observed. This long-range, cross-regional inhibition may allow precise synchronization of population activity by timing the occurrence of action potentials in the principal cells and may contribute to the coordinated induction of synaptic plasticity in distributed networks.
