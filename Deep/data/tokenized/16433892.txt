Previous studies have shown that injection of D-galactose could result in senescent performances in animals, that injection of NaNO2 could cause ischaemia and hypoxia in many organs, and combined injection of D-galactose and NaNO2 make normal mice taking on senescent performances in a shorter period. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of CE, an extract from a Tibetan medicinal herb, Coeloglossum. viride (L.) Hartm. var. bracteatum (Willd.), on senescent mice. The step-down test was performed to evaluate the learning and memory function of mice. The activities of superoxide dismutase, adenosine triphosphatase, monoamine oxydase and the content of malondialdehyde were measured to determine the impairment of brain. The expressions of Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3 proteins in mouse hippocampus were studied by immunohistochemical staining. The data demonstrated that D-galactose and NaNO2 treated mice had significant deficits in learning and memory function. The reduced activities of superoxide dismutase, adenosine triphosphatase, increased activities of monoamine oxydase and level of malondialdehyde were also found. Bax and caspase-3 positive cells increased while Bcl-2 positive cells decreased remarkably. Treatment of CE (2.5, 5 mg.kg(-1)) ameliorated the memory impairment; rectified the biochemistry and neural system changes in mice. These results suggest that CE offers promise as a tool for treatment of senescence-related diseases.
