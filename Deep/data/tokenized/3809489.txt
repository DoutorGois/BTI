Correlation of magnetic resonance (MR) images with cryomicrotome sections and formalin-fixed sections of human brain documents that spin-echo MR imaging with short repetition time/short echo time pulse sequences can display the surface gyri of the inferomedial temporal lobe, including the temporal pole, the parahippocampal gyrus, the isthmus of the cingulate gyrus, the lateral and medial occipitotemporal gyri, and the inferior temporal gyrus; the associated sulci including the rhinal and collateral sulci, the occipitotemporal sulcus, and the anterior calcarine sulcus; the components and fiber tracts of the hippocampal formation including the pes hippocampi, the hippocampus, the subiculum, the dentate gyrus, the subsplenial gyri, the alveus, the fimbria, and the fornix; the fissures and sulci associated with the hippocampal formation, including the hippocampal fissure, dentatofimbrial fissure, and the choroidal fissure; the continuity between the cingulate gyrus and the parahippocampal gyrus through the isthmus of the cingulate gyrus; and the continuity between the callosal sulcus and the hippocampal fissure.
