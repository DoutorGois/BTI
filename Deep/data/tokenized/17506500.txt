Pseudopregnancy (PSP) in the female rat is a neuroendocrine condition that is induced by repeated and intermittent vaginocervical stimulation received during mating and involves the expression of bicircadian prolactin surges and cessation of normal estrous cyclicity for 10-12 days postmating. The temporal patterning and number of intromissions received by the female are critical for PSP initiation, and thus, short-term encoding of VCS occurs during transduction of intromissions into PSP. In this experiment, we characterized and compared the mating-induced neural activation patterns within amygdalar and hippocampal regions using expression of the immediate early genes FOS, EGR-1, and ARC. Cycling female rats mated on proestrus received 15 or 5 intromissions under paced or nonpaced mating conditions. High numbers of intromissions during nonpaced mating or low numbers received during paced mating are sufficient to induce PSP, while five nonpaced intromissions and mounts without intromission are insufficient. Here we demonstrate that the CA1 region of the hippocampus was selectively sensitive to PSP-sufficient but not PSP-insufficient mating stimulation by showing significant effects of paced mating for all three IEGs. Paced mating also stimulated the expression of ARC within the basolateral, cortical, and central nuclei of the amygdala. The posterodorsal medial amygdala also showed selective EGR-1 responses to PSP-sufficient mating stimulation. There was no effect of hemisphere on IEG expression. The postmating expression profiles of these IEGs provide evidence that limbic areas involved in encoding and consolidation of memory are involved in initiating the neuroendocrine memory of PSP.
