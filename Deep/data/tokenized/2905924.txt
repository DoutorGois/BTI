Excitatory amino acid receptors in the neonatal rat hippocampus have opposing actions on phosphoinositide (PI) metabolism. Quisqualic acid (QA), but not the QA receptor agonist AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid), potently stimulates inositol phosphate (IP) formation. Activation of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors inhibits the QA-induced stimulation by 70% by a mechanism which is dependent on extracellular calcium.
