The actions of the insecticide avermectin (AVM) were studied in rat cultured hippocampal neurons with patch-clamp techniques. Application of micromolar concentrations of AVM to voltage-clamped cells gave rise to whole-cell currents, which showed a slow time-course of activation in the order of 10 s, and wash-out periods of typically 20 min. Dose-response curves revealed a half-maximally activating AVM concentration (EC50) of 2.0 +/- 0.6 microM and a Hill coefficient of 1.5 +/- 0.9. The current activated by AVM was carried predominantly by Cl- ions, as demonstrated by ion-substitution experiments. The Cl- channel blocker picrotoxinin (100 microM) substantially but transiently reduced the AVM response. Outside-out patch recording showed that AVM opened Cl- channels with a conductance of 40 +/- 12 pS. The open-time distribution was characterized by two time constants of 11 ms and 259 ms. It is suggested that AVM directly activates Cl- channels in mammalian central neurons, which resemble the channels activated by the physiological transmitters GABA and glycine.
