Progenitor cells in the subgranular zone of the hippocampus may be of significance for functional recovery after various injuries because they have a regenerative potential to form new neuronal cells. The hippocampus has been shown to express the GH secretagogue (GHS) receptor 1a, and recent studies suggest GHS to both promote neurogenesis and have neuroprotective effects. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether GHS could stimulate cellular proliferation and exert cell protective effects in adult rat hippocampal progenitor (AHP) cells. Both hexarelin and ghrelin stimulated increased incorporation of (3)H-thymidine, indicating an increased cell proliferation. Furthermore, hexarelin, but not ghrelin, showed protection against growth factor deprivation-induced apoptosis, as measured by annexin V binding and caspase-3 activity and also against necrosis, as measured by lactate dehydrogenase release. Hexarelin activated the MAPK and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathways, whereas ghrelin activated only the MAPK pathway. AHP cells did not express the GHS receptor 1a, but binding studies could show specific binding of both hexarelin and ghrelin, suggesting effects to be mediated by an alternative GHS receptor subtype. In conclusion, our results suggest a differential effect of hexarelin and ghrelin in AHP cells. We have demonstrated stimulation of (3)H-thymidine incorporation with both hexarelin and ghrelin. Hexarelin, but not ghrelin, also showed a significant inhibition of apoptosis and necrosis. These results suggest a novel cell protective and proliferative role for GHS in the central nervous system.
