Long-term potentiation (LTP) is the persistent facilitation of synaptic responses induced by a brief tetanic stimulation (tetanus). Replacement of a standard solution containing 2.0 mM Ca2+ with one containing 1.0 mM Ca2+ for 5 min, either immediately after or during tetanus, significantly inhibited the induction of LTP. Furthermore, similar results were obtained when Verapamil or Loperamide, presumable Ca2+ antagonists, was applied immediately after tetanus. From these results, it was concluded that the induction of LTP requires extracellular Ca2+ after as well as during tetanus.
