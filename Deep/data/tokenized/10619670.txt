The cellular distribution of the type VI human voltage-gated sodium channel (Type VI) was examined in selected human brain regions. Antibodies designed to be specific to rat and human Type VI were raised against a synthetic peptide from the predicted NH2-terminal of the protein, and used for an immunohistochemical investigation. Immunoblot experiments showed that purified antibodies specifically detected the presence of Type VI in transfected cells and human brain membrane preparations. Immunohistochemistry on perfusion fixed human tissue revealed a predominantly somato-dendritic distribution of Type VI in major output neurons of the cerebellum, cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The observed localisation of this channel may reflect an important role in the integration of synaptic input in the human CNS.
