Inhibitory postsynaptic currents were measured in CA1 pyramidal cells from chronically epileptic rats (pilocarpine model). Tiagabine, a selective inhibitor of the GABA-uptake transporter 1 prolonged currents equally to cells from control animals. Thus, GABA-uptake has an unaltered impact on inhibitory synaptic efficacy in rats with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy, underlining the rational for the use of GABA-uptake blockers in this condition.
