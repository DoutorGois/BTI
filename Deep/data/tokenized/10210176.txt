Autoradiography studies demonstrated that chronic "binge" cocaine administration increased mu-opioid receptor density in dopaminergically innervated rat brain regions, including the cingulate cortex, the nucleus accumbens, and the basolateral amygdala. The present study investigated the effects of a single day of binge-pattern cocaine administration (3 x 15 mg/kg, intraperitoneally [i.p.] at hourly intervals) on mu-opioid receptor mRNA levels in selected brain regions. Rats were sacrificed 30 min after the third injection and mRNA levels were measured by a quantitative solution hybridization RNase protection assay. Acute binge cocaine administration significantly increased mu-opioid receptor mRNA levels in the frontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and amygdala, but not in the caudate-putamen, thalamus, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. As has been suggested for other G-protein coupled receptors, the rapid increase of MOR mRNA reported in this study might represent an adaptive response to compensate for a decrease in number of receptors following cocaine-induced opioid peptide release.
