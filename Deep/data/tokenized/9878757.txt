Hippocampal and select cortical neuronal populations in Alzheimer's disease exhibit phenotypic changes characteristic of cells re-entering the cell division cycle. Therefore, in this study, we investigated whether components, known to trigger cellular proliferation and differentiation, upstream of the ras/mitogen-activated kinase pathway, could contribute to the activation of a signal transduction cascade in Alzheimer's disease. We found that proteins implicated in signal transduction from cell surface receptors via the ras pathway, namely Grb2 and SOS-1, were altered in cases of Alzheimer's disease in comparison to age-matched controls. SOS is increased in susceptible pyramidal neurons, while Grb2 shows more subtle alterations in subcellular distribution. Importantly, both SOS-1 and Grb2 show considerable overlap with early cytoskeletal abnormalities suggesting that the alteration in signal transduction molecules is a concurrent, if not preceding, event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Taken together with the cell cycle abnormalities previously reported, these findings suggest that a signal derived from the cell surface contributes to a stimulus for neurons in Alzheimer's disease to re-enter the cell cycle.
