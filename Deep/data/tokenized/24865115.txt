In this study, we evaluated, in the mouse, the effects of 20 mg/kg i.p. daily administration for 15 consecutive days of a blend of polyphenols, containing mostly oleuropein, extracted from the olive leaves (Olea europaea) on brain nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and on the expression of their receptors, TrkA, TrkB and p75. Polyphenols decreased the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and increased the levels of NGF and BDNF in the serum. In the brain, we found decreased levels of NGF and BDNF in the hippocampus and striatum but elevated levels of NGF in the olfactory lobes and hypothalamus and again BDNF potentiation in the olfactory lobes. No changes in TrkA, TrkB and p75 expression were observed. In conclusion, olive polyphenols may not only elicit an activation of the rodent olfactory system by increasing the levels of NGF and BDNF but also be stressing for the animal by reducing both the levels of hippocampal NGF/BDNF and serum GSH and increasing serum levels of NGF and BDNF.
