The cleft-type cyclophanes (ACCn, DNCn and TsDCn) were found to strongly inhibit macroscopic currents at heteromeric NMDA receptors (NR1/NR2) but not AMPA receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes at voltage-clamp recording. The inhibition by cleft-type cyclophanes was voltage-dependent, because the inhibition was larger at -100 mV than at -20 mV. Mutations at NR1 N650, located in the vestibule of the channel pore, reduced the inhibition by DNCn and TsDCn, suggesting that the residue (N650) interacts with these cleft-type cyclophanes. Cell toxicity of TsDCn on SH-SY5Y cells was slightly weaker than that of memantine. The neuroprotective effects of cleft-type cyclophanes against cell damage caused by NMDA were investigated in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Addition of 10 microM DNCn or TsDCn into the medium ablated the neurotoxicity induced by NMDA, and a similar effect was also observed with memantine. The neuroprotective effects of cleft-type cyclophanes were then assayed on NMDA-induced seizures in mice. Intracerebroventricular injection of TsDCn (5 mg/mouse) decreased the seizure induced by intraperitoneal injection of NMDA (115 mg/kg) in mice. The results demonstrate that these cleft-type cyclophanes interact directly with the extracellular mouth of the NMDA channel pore and exhibit neuroprotective effects on NMDA-induced excitatory toxicity in primary cultured neurons and mice.
