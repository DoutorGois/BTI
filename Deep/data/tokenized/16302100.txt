It has been demonstrated that exposure to a variety of stressful experiences enhances fearful reactions when behavior is tested in current animal models of anxiety. Until now, no study has examined the neurochemical changes during the test and retest sessions of rats submitted to the elevated plus maze (EPM). The present study uses a new approach (HPLC) by looking at the changes in dopamine and serotonin levels in the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, dorsal hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens in animals upon single or double exposure to the EPM (one-trial tolerance). The study involved two experiments: i) saline or midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) before the first trial, and ii) saline or midazolam before the second trial. For the biochemical analysis a control group injected with saline and not tested in the EPM was included. Stressful stimuli in the EPM were able to elicit one-trial tolerance to midazolam on re-exposure (61.01%). Significant decreases in serotonin contents occurred in the prefrontal cortex (38.74%), amygdala (78.96%), dorsal hippocampus (70.33%), and nucleus accumbens (73.58%) of the animals tested in the EPM (P < 0.05 in all cases in relation to controls not exposed to the EPM). A significant decrease in dopamine content was also observed in the amygdala (54.74%, P < 0.05). These changes were maintained across trials. There was no change in the turnover rates of these monoamines. We suggest that exposure to the EPM causes reduced monoaminergic neurotransmission activity in limbic structures, which appears to underlie the "one-trial tolerance" phenomenon.
