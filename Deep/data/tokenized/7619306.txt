The presentation of some odorous materials such as xylene or toluene under the snout of rats has been shown to elicit 15-30 Hz fast-wave bursts in both the olfactory bulb and dentate gyrus. Electrical stimulation of the olfactory bulb elicits an evoked potential (latency of first peak is 16-18 ms) in the dentate gyrus. The present study demonstrates that scopolamine or atropine blocks toluene-induced fast-wave bursts in the dentate region and to a lesser degree in the olfactory bulb while leaving dentate gyrus electrically evoked potentials intact. Further, rhythmical burst stimulation of the olfactory bulb at fast-wave frequencies will elicit fast-wave-like oscillations in the dentate gyrus. These fast-wave-like events, unlike evoked potentials to single-pulse stimulation, are abolished after muscarinic receptor antagonism with atropine. Mechanisms at the olfactory bulb and dentate gyrus that produce fast oscillations may involve muscarinic cholinergic synapses while the simple transmission of single, non-oscillatory olfactory signals to the dentate gyrus does not.
