In male Wistar rats, ascorbic acid (AA) (1 gr/kg i.p.) significantly (P less than 0.05) decreased the rate of CAR in the shuttle box avoidance test and antagonized the d-amphetamine (d-A) (1 mg/kg s.c.)-induced increase of CAR. Shuttle box test reduced striatal dopamine (DA) levels by about 86% (with a consistent 2-3 fold increase of DOPAC levels). DA levels were greatly reduced also in hypothalamus (HYP) and in hippocampus (HIP). AA further decreased striatal DA but significantly antagonized the reduction of DA levels in HYP and HIP. d-A antagonized the reduction of DA levels in all the above brain regions. Shuttle box test reduced noradrenaline (NA) levels mainly in HIP (-52%) and again d-A showed a significant protective effect in all regions; AA did not interfere with NA level reduction in striatum (ST) and HYP, but antagonized it in HIP. It is concluded that striatal DA system plays an important role in rat operant active avoidance behaviour. AA seems to exert a negative modulatory activity which can be counteracted by d-A.
