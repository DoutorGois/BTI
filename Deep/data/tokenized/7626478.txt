The experiments reported here add further evidence in support of the view that sex steroids may influence the binding characteristics of brain opioid receptors. In particular, it has been shown that: (a) the number of mu-opioid receptors varies in the hypothalamus of regularly cycling female rats according to the different phases of the estrous cycle, which are characterized by fluctuations of circulating levels of sex steroids; (b) the number of mu-opioid receptors decreases in the hypothalamus and in the corpus striatum when ovariectomized rats are submitted to treatments with estradiol and progesterone able to induce a "positive" feedback effect on LH release. A treatment with estrogen alone able to induce a "negative" feedback effect on LH release brings about an increase of the number of mu-opioid receptors in the thalamus and in the hippocampus; (c) in addition to the mu-receptors, receptors of the delta type may also be involved in the control of gonadotropin secretion; recent results here presented indicate that a line of immortalized hypothalamic cells (GT1 cells), which synthesize and secrete LHRH, present delta opioid receptors on their membranes; these are apparently involved in the control of LHRH release from these cells.
