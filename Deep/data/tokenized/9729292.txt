Previous studies have reported changes in insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) mRNA expression during early postnatal development of the rat brain. Although changes in IGF-I gene expression have been documented in a wide range of central nervous system structures during early development and investigated in the hippocampus during aging, no study has compared changes in IGF-I gene expression in different brain regions across the life span. The present study assessed the distribution of IGF-I gene expression using in situ hybridization in rats aged 2-30 months. Dot blots were used as a quantitative assessment of cortical IGF-I mRNA. Results indicate that both the distribution and levels of brain IGF-I mRNA do not change significantly between 2 and 30 months of age in the rat. However, in spite of relatively constant levels of mRNA, other studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that cortical IGF-I protein levels decrease 36.6% between 11 and 32 months of age, suggesting that IGF-I function is decreased with increasing age.
