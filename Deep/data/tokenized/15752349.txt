The role of oxidative stress in pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus was investigated by measuring lipid peroxidation level, nitrite content, GSH concentration, and superoxide dismutase and catalase activities in the hippocampus of Wistar rats. The control group was subcutaneously injected with 0.9% saline. The experimental group received pilocarpine (400 mg.kg(-1), subcutaneous). Both groups were killed 24 h after treatment. After the induction of status epilepticus, there were significant increases (77% and 51%, respectively) in lipid peroxidation and nitrite concentration, but a 55% decrease in GSH content. Catalase activity was augmented 88%, but superoxide dismutase activity remained unaltered. These results show evidence of neuronal damage in the hippocampus due to a decrease in GSH concentration and an increase in lipid peroxidation and nitrite content. GSH and catalase activity are involved in mechanisms responsible for eliminating oxygen free radicals during the establishment of status epilepticus in the hippocampus. In contrast, no correlations between superoxide dismutase and catalase activities were observed. Our results suggest that GSH and catalase activity play an antioxidant role in the hippocampus during status epilepticus.
