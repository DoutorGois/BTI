OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of total flavones of Rhododendron simsii (TFR) on the activation of ERK induced by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in rats and its possible mechanism. METHODS: Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion were induced by 4-vessel occlusion in rats. Changes in electroencephalogram were recorded before and 10 min after ischemia and 5,10,15,30,45 and 60 min after reperfusion. The activation of ERK1/2 and p-ERK1/2 of cerebral cortex and hippocampus was investigated by western blot. RESULTS: Compared with sham-operate group, EEG amplitude decreased significantly after ischemia and recovered after reperfusion in NS control and at 45 min and 60 min, EEG amplitude of TFR (15, 30, 60 mg/kg) groups was significantly higher than that of NS control (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). TFR (30, 60 mg/kg) could increase the activation of ERK1/2 after cerebral ischmia-reperfusion. CONCLUSION: TFR (15, 30, 60 mg/kg) could significantly promote the recovery of EEG and the mechanism might be associated with the increase of the activation of ERK1/2 after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion.
