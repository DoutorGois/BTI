The motilin precursor cDNA has been isolated and sequenced from a cDNA library prepared from monkey small intestine. The sequence indicates a 345 bp open reading frame, a 63 bp 5' untranslated region and a 154 bp 3' untranslated region. The sequence encodes a 115 amino acid motilin precursor composed of a 25 amino acid signal peptide, the 22 amino acid motilin peptide and a 68 amino acid motilin associated peptide (MAP). Compared with the human motilin precursor cDNA, there are two amino acid substitutions in the signal peptide, one in motilin and four in the MAP. The presence of the motilin precursor in hypothalamus, hippocampus and cerebellum was demonstrated by RT-PCR.
