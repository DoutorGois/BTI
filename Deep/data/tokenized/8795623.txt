In hippocampal neurons, a slowly inactivating aminopyridine-sensitive transient potassium current, D-current, influences the time course of action potential repolarization and therefore activity-dependent Ca2+ entry. We used high-speed optical recording techniques to study the effects of selectively inhibiting D-current with 4-AP (40 microM) on transmission at the Schaffer collateral (CA3)-CA1 synapse in rat hippocampal slices stained with the voltage-sensitive dye RH-155. We observed that addition of 4-AP to the bathing solution resulted in (1) augmentation of a fast component of the optical signal corresponding to the postsynaptic EPSP and action potential, and (2) the appearance of a delayed depolarization of CA1 neurons and other adjacent cells. 4-AP appeared to alter the presynaptic action potential and the dynamics of synaptic transmission to both reduce the sensitivity of the postsynaptic EPSP and action potential to omega-toxin calcium channel blockers (omega-conotoxin GVIA and omega-agatoxin IVA) and the Ca(2+)-dependent potassium channel blocker charybdotoxin, and to increase sensitivity to the dihydropyridine nifedipine, the NMDA receptor blocker aminophosphonopentanoic acid, and the intracellular Ca2+ release inhibitor thapsigargin. The delayed depolarization induced by 4-AP was inhibited in hyperosmotic extracellular solution, suggesting that enhanced transmitter release resulted in increased accumulation of K+ in the extracellular space. Because 4-AP is a convulsant at concentrations similar to those used here, we suggest that the 4-AP-targeted channel(s) carrying D-current may contribute to the hyperexcitability associated with epilepsy.
