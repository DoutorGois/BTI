Shadow of prion protein is a gene potentially involved in the pathogenesis of prion diseases. However, the Shadoo protein encoded by this gene has not yet been studied in sheep, an important species in prion matters. Therefore, we developed a polyclonal antibody against ovine Shadoo and assessed the presence and distribution of this protein in the ovine brain by immunohistochemistry. The strongest staining level was found in the cerebellum (especially in the Purkinje cells) and in the pons, but cerebrum, hippocampus, pituitary gland, medulla oblongata, thalamus and hypothalamus were also immunopositive. Remarkably, a typical granular pattern was seen in most of the tested brain tissues, which might indicate that Shadoo is primarily expressed at synapses. The results of this study and the availability of an ovine anti-Shadoo antibody can contribute to future research on the function of Shadoo and on its potential involvement in prion diseases.
