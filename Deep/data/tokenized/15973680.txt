The process of postinjury hippocampal epileptogenesis may involve gradually developing dentate granule cell hyperexcitability caused by neuron loss and synaptic reorganization. We tested this hypothesis by repeatedly assessing granule cell excitability after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) and monitoring granule cell behavior during 235 spontaneous seizures in awake, chronically implanted rats. During the first week post-SE, granule cells exhibited diminished paired-pulse suppression and decreased seizure discharge thresholds in response to afferent stimulation. Spontaneous seizures often began during the first week after SE, recruited granule cell discharges that followed behavioral seizure onsets, and evoked c-Fos expression in all hippocampal neurons. Paired-pulse suppression and epileptiform discharge thresholds increased gradually after SE, eventually becoming abnormally elevated. In the chronic epileptic state, interictal granule cell hyperinhibition extended to the ictal state; granule cells did not discharge synchronously before any of 191 chronic seizures. Instead, granule cells generated only low-frequency voltage fluctuations (presumed "field excitatory postsynaptic potentials") during 89% of chronic seizures. Granule cell epileptiform discharges were recruited during 11% of spontaneous seizures, but these occurred only at the end of each behavioral seizure. Hippocampal c-Fos after chronic seizures was expressed primarily by inhibitory interneurons. Thus, granule cells became progressively less excitable, rather than hyperexcitable, as mossy fiber sprouting progressed and did not initiate the spontaneous behavioral seizures. These findings raise doubts about dentate granule cells as a source of spontaneous seizures in rats subjected to prolonged SE and suggest that dentate gyrus neuron loss and mossy fiber sprouting are not primary epileptogenic mechanisms in this animal model.
