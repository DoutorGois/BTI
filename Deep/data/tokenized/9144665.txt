A new phenylglycine derivative, (RS)-2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine (CHPG), has been synthesized and shown to selectively activate mGlu5a receptors, compared to mGlu1 alpha receptors, when expressed in CHO cells. This selective mGlu5 receptor agonist also potentiates NMDA-induced depolarizations in rat hippocampal slices. CHPG may be a useful tool for studying the role of mGlu5 receptors in the central nervous system.
