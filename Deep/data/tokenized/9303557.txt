Estrogens can protect neurons against oxidative stress-induced cell death due to their antioxidant potential. Here, we report that other aromatic alcohols with intact phenolic groups and different phenol derivatives can also protect neurons against oxidative cell death induced by glutamate and hydrogen peroxide in vitro. This neuroprotective activity was independent of the time the compound was added before the toxin. Methylation of the phenolic hydroxyl group led to a decrease or loss in neuroprotection. Moreover, the tested compounds directly inhibited peroxidation reactions, suggesting that neuroprotection is mediated by their antioxidant properties.
