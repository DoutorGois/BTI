The effect of microiontophoretically administered beta-endorphin on the activity of 62 cortical and hippocampal neurones was studied in acute experiments on 14 rats. The effectiveness of beta-endorphin was first of all verified in the isolated guinea pig ileum, the mouse was deferens and in a study if its analgetic and catatonic effect in rats. Beta-endorphin only mildly depressed the spontaneous activity of cortical neurones, but markedly inhibited the activity stimulated by the microiontophoretic administration of glutamate. In the hippocampus, beta-endorphin stimulated the activity of all the studied neurones when only low ejection currents were used and activation persisted for 1-4 min after terminating administration. With higher ejection currents, the discharge frequency rose enormously and not even GABA blocked this effect. The excitatory effect of beta-endorphin on the hippocampal neurones may possibly be the basis of the epileptogenic action of this substance.
