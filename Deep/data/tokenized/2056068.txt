Rats with bilateral electrolytic ventral hippocampal formation (VHF) lesion show a significantly (p less than 0.001) enhanced migration of leucocytes in the presence of antigen. Immunization in these animals enhances (p less than 0.001) the leucocyte migration and presents a significant decrease in footpad thickness. Antibody titre (p less than 0.001) and plaque-forming cells (p less than 0.02) also show a significant decrease when compared with sham-lesion-immunized animals and control-immunized animals. These data indicate the influence of VHF in modulating the specific immunity.
