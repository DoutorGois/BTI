Using in situ hybridization histochemistry concentrations of mRNAs encoding chromogranin A (ChA), carboxypeptidase H (CPH) and peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxigenase (PAM) have been investigated in the hippocampus after kainic acid (KA)-induced limbic seizures in the rat. Increased concentrations (by 150%) of ChA and CPH mRNAs were found in the granule cell layer 24 h after KA injection. At the same time PAM mRNA levels were only slightly elevated (by 50%). Whereas the increases in CPH and PAM transcripts were only transient, ChA mRNA concentrations in the granule cell layer were elevated up to 2 months after the initial seizures. In contrast, in the pyramidal cell layers of all hippocampal subfields (CA1 to CA3) ChA mRNA concentrations were significantly reduced (by 40-70%) 1-60 days after KA. PAM and CPH messages were slightly reduced in the pyramidal cell layer of CA1 but not in CA2 and CA3. The experiments demonstrate that KA-induced limbic seizures cause sustained changes in the expression of ChA mRNA. At the same time the expression of two enzymes involved in post-translational processing of neuropeptides, PAM and CPH, becomes only transiently altered. Synthesis of ChA may be regulated differently in the strata granulosum and pyramidale during epileptic seizures.
