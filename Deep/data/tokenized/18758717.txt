Activation of beta-adrenoceptors in area CA1 of the hippocampus facilitates in vitro long-term potentiation (LTP) in this region. However, it is unclear if in vivo LTP in area CA1 and hippocampus-dependent learning are subjected to beta-adrenergic regulation. To address this question, we investigated the effects of the beta-adrenergic agonist L-isoproterenol or antagonist DL-propranolol on in vivo LTP of area CA1 and the spatial learning in Morris water maze. In the presence of L-isoproterenol (through local infusion into area CA1), the theta-pulse stimulation with the parameter of 10 Hz, 150 pulses/train, 1 train, a frequency weakly modifying synaptic strength, induced a robust LTP, and this effect was blocked when DL-propranolol was co-administered. By contrast, the theta-pulse stimulation with the parameter of 5 Hz, 150 pulses/train, 3 trains, a frequency strongly modifying synaptic strength, induced a significantly smaller LTP when DL-propranolol was administered into area CA1. Accordingly, DL-propranolol impaired the spatial learning in the water maze when infused into area CA1 20 min pretraining. Compared with control rats, the DL-propranolol-treated rats showed significantly slower learning in the water maze and subsequently exhibited poor memory retention at 24-h test. These results suggest that beta-adrenoceptors in area CA1 are involved in regulating in vivo synaptic plasticity of this area and are important for spatial learning.
