The full-length cDNA encoding aminopeptidase A (APAL) was cloned from a rat hippocampus cDNA library. A short variant aminopeptidase A (APAS), produced by deletion, was also cloned. In the case of APAL, the longest open reading frame encodes 945 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 108 kDa, and the deduced amino acid sequence shows 76, 86 and 78% identity with its human, murine and porcine counterparts, respectively. Rat aminopeptidase A mRNAs were detected in the kidney, liver, heart and brain by Northern blot analysis. When overexpressed in COS-1 cells, APAL shows apparent aminopeptidase A activity, whereas APAS does not.
