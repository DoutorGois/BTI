BACKGROUND: Ethanol (EtOH) causes neurotoxicity via several mechanisms including neuroinflammation (during EtOH exposure), and excitotoxicity (during EtOH withdrawal [EWD]). Alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) selective agonists have the potential to reduce both. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective potential of rhamnetin, a dietary flavonoid with alpha7 nAChR selective activity, in an in vitro model of EtOH-induced neurotoxicity. METHODS: The anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties of rhamnetin were assessed in neonatal organotypic hippocampal slice cultures undergoing EWD (or not) and challenged with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and/or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Neurotoxicity was determined using propidium iodide uptake, and the inflammatory response was evaluated by measuring the release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (NO; quantified by ELISA) and nitric oxide (quantified by the Griess reaction) into culture media. RESULTS: As predicted, rhamnetin reduced LPS-induced release of TNF-alpha and NO both under control conditions and during EWD. Additionally, rhamnetin had no effect on NMDA-induced neurotoxicity under control conditions, but significantly reduced NMDA toxicity during EWD. In contrast, rhamnetin had no effect on neurotoxicity induced by NMDA and LPS combined despite reducing TNF-alpha and NO levels under these conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Rhamnetin is anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective during EWD and therefore has potential value in treating neurotoxicity caused by EtOH.
