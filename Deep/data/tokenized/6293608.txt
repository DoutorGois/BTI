It was suggested that diazepam action is mediated by the GABA-ergic system. This suggestion was controlled in vitro experiments with hippocampal slices. The GABA-ergic system was blocked by bicuculline and picrotoxin. The influence of diazepam (1 X 10(-6) M) on the population spikes (PS) evoked in the CA1 area by Schaffer's collaterals stimulation manifested itself in a reversible decrease. Bicuculline (1 X 10(-7) M) and picrotoxin (1 X 10(-6) M) induced an increase in the PS amplitude and appearance of additional PS. Diazepam was normally ineffective when applied in conjunction with bicuculline or picrotoxin. The data indicate that the action of diazepam is really mediated by the GABA-ergic system.
