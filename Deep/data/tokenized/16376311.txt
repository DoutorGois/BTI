gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is inhibitory in adult, but excitatory in neonatal, neurons. The switch from excitatory to inhibitory action is due to a negative shift in the equilibrium potential for the GABA(A) receptor-mediated postsynaptic current (E(GABA-PSC)). Here, we report that, in neonatal rat hippocampal CA1 neurons, presynaptic theta-burst activation induces not only a shift in E(GABA-PSC) towards that in adult neurons, but also a recruitment of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA)-receptor-mediated postsynaptic currents.
