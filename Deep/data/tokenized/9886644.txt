Population of interacting inhibitory hippocampal neurons is described by a continuous model. The explicit equation for the frequency of synchronized neural firing and the condition for its stability are obtained. The results of their numerical solution are in quantitative agreement with the data of Wang and Buzsaki, 1996 (J. Neurosci. 16, 6402-6413).
