The effects of resveratrol on the discharges of neurons in CA1 area of rat hippocampal slices were examined by using extracellular recording technique. The results are as follows: (1) In response to the application of resveratrol (0.05, 0.5, 5.0 micromol/L, n=52) into the superfusate for 2 min, the spontaneous discharge rate of 46/52 (88.5%) neurons was significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner; (2) Application of L-glutamate (0.2 mmol/L) into the superfusate led to a marked increase in discharge rate of all 8 (100%) slices in an epileptiform pattern. The increased discharges were suppressed by application of resveratrol (5.0 micromol/L); (3) In 7 slices, perfusion of the selective L-type calcium channel agonist, Bay K8644 (0.1 micromol/L), induced a significant increase in the discharge rate of 6/7 (85.7%) slices. The increased discharges were suppressed by application of resveratrol (5.0 micromol/L); (4) In 9 slices, perfusion of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 50 micromol/L) into the superfusate significantly augmented the discharge rate of 7/9 (77.8%) slices. Resveratrol (5.0 micromol/L) applied into the superfusate reduced the increased discharges of all 7/7 (100%) neurons; (5) In 10 units, the large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel blocker (tetraethylammonium chloride, TEA, 1 mmol/L) significantly increased the discharge rate of 9/10 (90%) slices. Resveratrol (5.0 micromol/L) applied into the superfusate inhibited the discharges of 8/9 (88.9%) slices. These results suggest that resveratrol inhibits the electrical activity of CA1 neurons. This effect may be related to the blockade of L-type calcium channel and a subsequent reduction of calcium influx, and probably has no association with large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel.
