Detrimental effects of volatile anaesthetics, including sevoflurane, on the structure and function of the developing brain have been reported. The internalization of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) contributes to anaesthetic neurotoxicity. Both nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and NMDAR play a critical role in the development of the nervous system. Moreover, nAChR can interact with NMDAR, and previous studies have demonstrated modulation of NMDAR by nAChR. In our study, we used an alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7nAChR) agonist and alpha7nAChR antagonist to explore the role of alpha7nAChR and NMDAR in sevoflurane-induced long-term effects on memory and dendritic spine both in vivo and in vitro. The results revealed that the activation of alpha7nAChR attenuated the development of sevoflurane-induced memory deficit and dendritic spine changes, which might be by regulating NR2B-containing NMDAR trafficking from the intracellular pool to the cell surface pool in the hippocampus. Moreover, we demonstrated that alpha7nAChR could regulate NR2B-containing NMDAR via Src-family tyrosine kinase (SFK). Thus, our current study indicates that the trafficking of NR2B-containing NMDAR is regulated by alpha7nAChR via SFK in neonatal rat hippocampus, which may be secondary to sevoflurane-induced cognitive deficits in the developing hippocampus.
