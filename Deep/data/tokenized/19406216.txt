Hypothermia is an effective method for reducing the neuronal damage induced by hypoxia-ischemia (HI) but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. To investigate the effects of post-HI hypothermia on the developing brain, 7-day-old rats were subjected to left carotid artery ligation followed by 8% oxygen for 2h. They were divided into a hypothermia group (rectal temperature 32-33 degrees C for 24h) and a normothermia group (36-37 degrees C for 24h) immediately after hypoxia-ischemia. Animals were sacrificed at 12, 24 and 72 h for gene analysis and 0, 1, 3 and 7 days for protein analysis after HI. There was a significant decrease in infarct volume in the hypothermia group at 7 days after HI compared with that in the normothermia group. The hypothermia group had more neuronal nuclei (NeuN) positive neurons and lower levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) mRNA and immunoreactivity in the hippocampus CA1 region than the normothermia group. Real-time PCR showed no significant difference in glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) mRNA expression in the hippocampus in the two groups at various time points after HI. However, GDNF protein level was significantly increased in the hypothermia group. On the other hand, mRNA and protein levels of the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were dramatically decreased in the hypothermia compared with the normothermia group. The present findings highlight an apparent association between inhibition of hippocampal neuron loss by hypothermia and decreased astrocytosis and inflammatory cytokine release after hypoxia-ischemia in the developing brain.
