The ATP-dependent glutamate uptake system of synaptic vesicles was investigated in epileptic (EL) mice to determine whether glutamate uptake activity correlates with seizure susceptibility or development. Given the focal seizure onset, glutamate uptake activity was measured in four separate brain regions: cerebrum (minus hippocampus), hippocampus, cerebellum, and brain stem. The EL values were compared to those of age-matched controls; DDY and ABP/LeJ (ABP) mice. The glutamate uptake specific activity for EL cerebrum was significantly higher than that for the control mice (approx. 400 days old), but was not elevated prior to seizure onset (46 days old). No difference in glutamate uptake was observed between the strains in the other brain regions. We conclude that increased synaptic vesicle glutamate uptake is brain-region specific (cerebrum) and is associated with the development or maintenance, rather than the initial cause, of seizures in the EL model of epilepsy.
