In order to analyze the elementary mechanisms underlying caffeine-induced epileptiform discharges, hippocampal slices of guinea pigs were exposed to this drug. When the bath concentration of caffeine exceeded 0.2 mM, periodically occurring paroxysmal depolarizations (PD) in CA3 neurons appeared. They were accompanied by declines of extracellular free calcium concentration and were suppressed by the organic calcium antagonists verapamil and flunarizine. PD-like fluctuations of the membrane potential could be evoked also in CA3 neurons functionally isolated by tetrodotoxin (TTX). The observations indicate that caffeine-induced PD are generated endogenously and that transmembranous calcium currents contribute to these mechanisms.
