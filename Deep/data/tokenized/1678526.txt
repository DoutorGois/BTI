Stimulation of the perforant path, a major input to the hippocampal formation, produced significant decreases in the hippocampal levels of methionine enkephalin, dynorphin A(1-8) and an increase in the hippocampal level of gamma-aminobutyric acid. In addition, it was also observed that both mu and delta opioid receptor antagonists reduce wet dog shakes elicited by perforant path stimulation. The antagonists did not affect the changes in hippocampal levels of methionine enkephalin, dynorphin A(1-8) or gamma-aminobutyric acid. The results demonstrate that endogenous opioids are involved in the wet dog shakes elicited by perforant path stimulation. Since electrographic seizure activity occurs in the hippocampus in conjunction with perforant path stimulation-induced wet dog shakes, these data provide further evidence that endogenous opioid peptides play an important role in regulation of limbic system epileptogenic phenomena.
