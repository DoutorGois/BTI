The premise of neuroprotective therapy for acute ischemic stroke is based upon the possibility to interfere with the cellular ischemic cascade, so the understanding of the mechanisms and consequences of cerebral ischemia is necessary. The relationship between lipid peroxidation and acidosis was investigated in several regions of rat brain following ischemia without reperfusion. Male Wistar rats (280-300 g) were anaesthetised (Ketalar 33 mg/kg and Rompun 6.66 mg/kg) or not and underwent a four-vessel occlusion for 5 minutes. Then, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and lactate levels were measured in different brain regions (cerebellum, bulb, striatum, hippocampus, cortex). Induction of ischemia by ligation of two common carotid arteries and two vertebral arteries resulted in a production of TBARS (40-120%, p < 0.05) and lactate (20-60%, p < 0.05) in all cerebral regions of awake rats, especially in striatum, suggesting a potential link between lipid peroxidation and acidosis. When ischemia was realised on anaesthetised animals, an increase of lactate levels (30-50%, p < 0.05) was shown in all brain regions but TBARS were produced only in striatum (82%, p < 0.05). These data showed the particular vulnerability of striatum to ischemia and the possible opposite effects of an anaesthesia.
