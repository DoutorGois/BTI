BACKGROUND: Long-term potentiation (LTP) is well recognized as a cellular-correlated synaptic plasticity of learning and memory. However, its reversal forms of synaptic plasticity, depotentiation, is less studied and its association with behaviors is also far from clear. Previously, we have shown that nanomolar orexin A can prevent the depotentiation induced by low frequency stimulation (LFS) following theta burst stimulation-induced LTP, namely inducing re-potentiation, at hippocampal CA1 synapses in vitro. Here, we explored the functional correlate of this orexin-mediated hippocampal re-potentiation. METHODS AND RESULTS: We found that intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection process-paired contextual exposures during the conditioned place preference (CPP) task in mice resulted in re-potentiation at CA1 synapses of hippocampal slices, regardless of whether the CPP behavior is expressed or not. Simply exposing the mouse in the CPP apparatus, or giving the mouse consecutive i.p. injections of saline in its home cage or a novel cage did not lead to hippocampal re-potentiation. Besides, this CPP training process-induced hippocampal re-potentiation was prevented when mice were pretreated with TCS1102, a dual orexin receptor antagonist. These results suggest that the expression of hippocampal re-potentiation is orexin-dependent and requires the association of differential spatial contexts and i.p. injections in the CPP apparatus. CONCLUSIONS: Together, we reveal an unprecedentedly orexin-mediated modulation on hippocampal depotentiation by the training process in the CPP paradigm.
