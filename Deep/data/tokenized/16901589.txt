On the basis of the evidence that the excitability of hippocampal glutamatergic neurotransmitter system is enhanced by dietary zinc deficiency, the response of amygdalar neurotransmitter system was checked in young rats fed a zinc-deficient diet for 4 weeks. Extracellular zinc concentration in the amygdala, which was measured by the in vivo microdialysis, was almost the same as that in the hippocampus and decreased by zinc deficiency. Extracellular zinc concentration in the amygdala was increased both in the control and zinc-deficient rats by stimulation with 100mM KCl, suggesting that the increase in extracellular zinc in the amygdala, as well as that in the hippocampus, is linked with neuronal depolarization. In amygdalar extracellular fluid, the basal glutamate concentration was not significantly different between the control and zinc-deficient rats and was increased to almost the same extent between them by stimulation with 100mM KCl, unlike more increase in extracellular glutamate concentration in the hippocampus in zinc deficiency. On the other hand, the basal GABA concentration in the amygdalar extracellular fluid was significantly lower in zinc-deficient rats and was not increased both in the control and zinc-deficient rats by stimulation with 100mM KCl. These results suggest that GABAergic neurotransmitter system is critically impaired in the amygdala of young rats after 4-week zinc deprivation.
