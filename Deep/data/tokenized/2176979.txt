The biochemical, electrophysiological and pharmacological properties of the new GABAB receptor blocker CGP 35348 are described. In a variety of receptor binding assays CGP 35348 showed affinity for the GABAB receptor only. CGP 35348 had an IC50 of 34 microM at the GABAB receptor. The compound antagonized (100, 300, 1000 microM) the potentiating effect of L-baclofen on noradrenaline-induced stimulation of adenylate cyclase in rat cortex slices. In electrophysiological studies CGP 35348 (10, 100 microM) antagonized the effect of L-baclofen in the isolated rat spinal cord. In the hippocampal slice preparation CGP 35348 (10, 30, 100 microM) blocked the membrane hyperpolarization induced by D/L-baclofen (10 microM) and the late inhibitory postsynaptic potential. CGP 35348 appeared to be 10-30 times more potent than the GABAB receptor blocker phaclofen. Ionophoretic and behavioural experiments showed that GABAB receptors in the brain were blocked after i.p. administration of CGP 35348. This compound may be of considerable value in elucidating the roles of brain GABAB receptors.
