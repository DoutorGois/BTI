Endogenous cyclical changes in the levels of estrogen can have marked effects on hippocampal synaptic plasticity. In two experiments, we examined the effect of chronic estrogen loss and replacement following ovariectomy on the induction of bidirectional changes in synaptic plasticity in the CA1 region in vivo. In Experiment 1, ovariectomy carried out either 5 days or 5 weeks before testing impaired the induction of long-term depression (LTD) and but not long-term potentiation (LTP). In Experiment 2, chronic estrogen replacement (0.2 ml of 10 microg injection of 17beta-estradiol every 48 h) over the course of 5 weeks enhanced the magnitude of paired-pulse-induced LTD in the CA1 region but had no effect on the induction of LTP. The results demonstrate that acute and chronic estrogen deprivation disrupted dynamic synaptic plasticity processes in the hippocampal CA1 region and that this disruption was ameliorated by chronic estrogen replacement. The findings are discussed with reference to: (1) the contribution of Ca(2+) regulated synaptic signalling pathways in the CA1 region to estradiol modulation of LTP and LTD and (2) the potential functional significance of ovariectomy-induced changes in synaptic plasticity for learning and memory processes.
