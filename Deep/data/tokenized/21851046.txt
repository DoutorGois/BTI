One of the pathways implicated in a fine-tuning control of neurosecretory process is the activation of presynaptic receptors. The present study was focused on the role of presynaptic glutamate receptor activation in the regulation of inhibitory synaptic transmission in the rat hippocampus and cortex. We aimed to clarify what types of ionotropic glutamate receptors are involved in the modulation of GABA secretion, and what mechanism underlies this modulation. We have revealed that specific agonists of kainate and NMDA receptors, kainate and NMDA, like glutamate, induced the release of [3H]GABA from hippocampal and cortical nerve terminals suggesting the involvement of both types in the regulation of GABAergic transmission. Our results indicate preferential involvement of vesicular, but not cytosolic, pool in response to glutamate receptor activation. This is based on the finding that NO-711 (a specific inhibitor of plasma membrane GABA transporters), fails to attenuate [3H]GABA release. We have concluded that presynaptic glutamate receptor-induced modulation of the strength of synaptic response is due to increasing the release probability of synaptic vesicles.
