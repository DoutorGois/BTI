It has been reported that the hippocampus is very susceptible to methamphetamine (METH) and that neuropeptide Y (NPY) is an important neuroprotective agent against hippocampal excitotoxicity. However, there is very little information regarding the role of the NPYergic system in this brain region under conditions of METH toxicity. To clarify this issue, we investigated the role of NPY and its receptors against METH-induced neuronal cell death in hippocampal organotypic slice cultures. Our data show that NPY (1 mum) is neuroprotective in DG, CA3 and CA1 subregions via Y(2) receptors. Moreover, the selective activation of Y(1) receptors (1 mum [Leu(31) ,Pro(34) ]NPY) partially prevented the toxicity induced by METH in DG and CA3 subfields, but completely blocked its toxicity in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer. Regarding Y(2) receptors, its activation (300 nm NPY13-36) completely prevented METH-induced toxicity in all subregions analysed, which involved changes in levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bax, respectively. Besides neuronal cell death, we also showed that METH triggers a microglial response in the mouse hippocampus which was attenuated by Y(2) receptor activation. To better clarify the effect of METH and the NPY system on microglial cells, we further used the N9 microglial cell line. We found that both NPY and the Y(2) receptor agonist were able to protect microglia against METH-induced cell death. Overall, our data demonstrate that METH is toxic to both neurons and microglial cells, and that NPY, mainly via Y(2) receptors, has an important protective role against METH-induced cell death and microgliosis.
