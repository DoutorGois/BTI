Tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., imipramine, desipramine) are currently used in the treatment of mood disorders such as depression. At the cellular level they inhibit the re-uptake of the exocytosed monoamines serotonin and noradrenaline. However, they also stimulate phospholipase C activity and the production of the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Since phospholipase C activation can also lead to the production of the protein kinase C activator diacylglycerol, we have undertaken experiments to see whether acutely applied desipramine could change the synaptic strength of neurons in a protein kinase C-dependent manner. Experiments performed with cultured hippocampal neurons dissociated from neonatal rats revealed that desipramine rapidly enhanced the spontaneous vesicular release of glutamate. This was observed by measuring the frequency of tetrodotoxin-resistant spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents. Analysis of amplitude distribution histograms indicated a presynaptic site of action. The protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine and down-regulation of protein kinase C activity greatly reduced the desipramine-dependent enhancement of the frequency of tetrodotoxin-resistant spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents. This presynaptic modulation requires SNARE proteins because cleavage of SNAP-25 with the botulinum neurotoxin A strongly reduced the desipramine-induced glutamate release. Thus, acute applications of desipramine stimulated the ongoing neurotransmitter release pathway, probably by activating protein kinase C. Our data indicate that tricyclic antidepressant drugs not only act on serotoninergic and/or noradrenergic cells but can also modify the activity of glutamatergic neurons.
