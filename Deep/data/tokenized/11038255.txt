To investigate the distribution of GABA(A) receptor alpha5 subunit expression in brain, polyclonal antisera were raised, characterised and applied to human and rat brain sections. The resultant antibodies detected a major band of 53 kDa in sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis immunoblots. Abundant immunostaining was demonstrated in the hippocampal formation in multiple cell types, although predominantly in pyramidal neurons. These data are supportive of GABA-ergic involvement in cognition, and suggest that this influence may be mediated through receptors containing the alpha5 subunit.
