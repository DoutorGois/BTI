Liposome-encapsulated hemoglobin (LEH) was proven to be protective in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. The present study evaluated LEH in a rat model of permanent middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion to clarify its effect during ischemia and reperfusion. Five minutes after thread occlusion of the MCA, rats were infused with 10 mL/kg of LEH (LEH, n = 13), and compared with normal controls (n = 11). Additional animals received the same MCA occlusion with no treatment (CT, n = 11), saline (saline, n = 10), empty liposome solution (EL, n = 13), or washed red blood cells (RBC, n = 7). Severity of brain edema was determined 24 h later by signal strength in T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and pyriform lobe. The results showed that brain edema/infarction observed in any vehicle-infused control was significantly more severe than in LEH-treated rats. There was a tendency toward aggravated edema in rats receiving ELs. LEH infusion at a dose of 10 mL/kg significantly reduced edema formation as compared to other treatments in a wide area of the brain 24 h after permanent occlusion of the MCA. Low oncotic pressure of EL and LEH solution (vehicle solution) appeared to cause nonsignificant aggravation of edema and reduced protective effects of LEH.
