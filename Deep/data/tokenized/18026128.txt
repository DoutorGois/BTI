BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Based on their proven ability, in animal models of stroke, to reduce damage to brain grey matter, many drugs have been tested in clinical trials but without success. Failure to save axons from injury and to protect functional outcome has been proposed as the major reason for this lack of success. We have previously demonstrated in two rodent models of cerebral ischaemia, that AS601245 (1,3-benzothiazol-2-yl (2-([2-(3-pyridinyl) ethyl] amino)-4 pyrimidinyl) acetonitrile), an inhibitor of the c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK), has neuroprotective properties. The aim of the present study was to further investigate if AS601245 in addition to its ability to protect neurons also could protect neurites and preserve memory after cerebral ischaemia, in gerbils. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Using immunohistochemical techniques and a behavioural test, we studied the effect of the compound AS601245 on neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits after global cerebral ischaemia in gerbils. KEY RESULTS: At a dose of 80 mg kg(-1), i.p., AS601245 reduced damage to neurites by 67% (P<0.001 versus controls) and activation of astrocytes by 84% (P<0.001 versus controls). In addition, AS601245 (80 mg kg(-1), i.p.) prevented ischaemia-induced impairment of memory in the inhibitory avoidance task model. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The present results suggest that AS601245 reduced damage to neurites and decreased astrogliosis following global ischaemia and also improved long-term memory, supporting JNK inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy for ischaemic insults to the CNS.
