Typical alterations in activity of transport ATPases were observed in crude mitochondrial fractions isolated from various rat brain parts after chronic stressor effects. In the acute period of stress reaction activity of Na+, K+-ATPase was increased in synaptosomes of frontal cortex, hypothalamus and hippocamp. The enzymatic activity normalized after chronic action of the stressor agents. But under these conditions the activity of Mg2+-ATPase was distinctly decreased in cortex, hypothalamus and in pons Varolii.
