Repeated electrical evocation of afterdischarges in the perforant-path ventral hippocampal system of the cat produces lasting changes in species characteristic behavioral responses to environmental threat. After 7 to 12 afterdischarges, cats showed greatly enhanced defensive (withdrawal) responses to rats, and mildly enhanced defensive responses toward mice. Measures of predatory attack which negatively correlate with withdrawal from rats were also changed in a direction consistent with the increase in withdrawal tendency. There was little effect of afterdischarges on the same parameters of attack on mice. Thus the stimulation seemed to attenuate predatory aggression by increasing defensive sensitivity to the threat posed by prey self-defense, and not by reducing predatory motivation per se. The change in defensiveness was not restricted to the predatory test situation, however. Tests of defensive response to conspecific threat vocalizations revealed an increased defensive responding to this stimulus as well. On the other hand, there was no change in social responsiveness shown toward a highly familiar human. Given the sudden onset (1 hr to 24 hr after the last afterdischarge), the long-lasting nature of the change (30-60 days) which persisted in the absence of seizures, and the generality of expression of the behavioral change, it was concluded that the afterdischarges produced an interictally maintained alteration in a defensive personality characteristic of the cats.
