Global cerebral ischemia (GCI) results in death of the pyramidal neurons in the CA1 layer of the hippocampus. In this study we used the four-vessel occlusion (4VO) model of GCI to investigate a potential neuroprotective role of bone-marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) transplantation. BMMCs (3x10(7)) were injected through the carotid artery, 1 or 3 days after ischemia (DAI), and the number of cells undergoing degeneration was investigated in brains at 7 DAI. A significant decrease in the number of dying cells was observed in the treated group, compared to animals treated with saline. Biodistribution of the injected cells (1 or 3 DAI) was investigated by (99m)Technetium labeling of the BMMCs and subsequent image analysis 2h after transplantation. In addition, the presence of CellTrace()-labeled BMMCs was investigated in tissue sections of the hippocampal area of these transplanted animals. BMMCs treatment significantly reduced the number of FJ-C positive cells in the hippocampal CA1 layer at 7 DAI. We also observed a decrease in the number of activated microglia/macrophage (ED1-positive cells) in the BMMCs-treated group compared with the untreated group. Our data show that BMMCs are able to modulate the microglial response and reduce neurodegeneration in the CA1 layer.
