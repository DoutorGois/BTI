Synaptic plasticity in the amygdala appears to be necessary for the generation of emotional memories. However, the molecular bases of this plasticity are not fully understood. Because the polysialylated form of the neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) has been implicated in memory consolidation in the hippocampus and temporal cortex, we have studied in detail the expression of this molecule in the adult rat amygdala with an antibody against PSA-NCAM. Our results demonstrate for the first time the presence of PSA-NCAM in the adult rat amygdala. Immunoreactive somata and processes are abundant in the amygdalo-hippocampal transition area, central nucleus, intra-amygdaloid bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, anterior and posterior cortical nuclei, periamygdaloid cortex and medial nucleus of the amygdala. In addition PSA-NCAM immunoreactive neuronal somata and processes exist in the lateral, basal and accessory basal nuclei, anterior amygdaloid area and amygdalo-striatal area. The presence of this molecule in areas that receive olfactory or vomeronasal input could reflect the intrinsic plasticity of these chemosensory systems. PSA-NCAM expression in the lateral amygdala could indicate its participation in the plastic events that lead to the generation of emotional memories such as those related to fear conditioning.
