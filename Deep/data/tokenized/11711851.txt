The microtubule-associated tau proteins are abnormally aggregated in many tauopathies. Phosphorylation modulates the functions of tau. The serine 199 residue of tau is abnormally phosphorylated at early and late stages of Alzheimer's disease. The presence of the phosphorylated Ser199 was investigated in autopsy-derived and biopsy-derived brain tissue samples from non-demented individuals. A paradoxical expression was found in the hippocampus of the youngest ones, in granule cells of the dentate gyrus and in pyramidal cells of the Ammon's horn, which are particularly prone to neurodegeneration in several tauopathies. The rate of positive cells decreased with age. These data emphasize the importance of the phosphorylation of the Ser199 residue of tau in ageing and susceptibility to neurodegeneration.
