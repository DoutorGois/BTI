Glutamate antibodies intranasally administered to Wistar rats at a dose of 300 mug/kg reduced the elevated levels of expression of Aifml, Casp3, and Parp 1 genes in the prefrontal cortex and Aifml and Casp3 genes in the hippocampus on the third day after administration of the beta-amyloid fragment Abeta25-35 into the Meynert nuclei of the brain. Changes in Aifm1, Bax, Casp3, and Parp 1 gene expression were not found in the hypothalamus, and changes in Bax gene expression were not found in the brain structures studied. The discovered features of gene expression in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus are considered in terms of development of various cell-death programs, which are modulated by glutamate antibodies.
