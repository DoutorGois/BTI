The immunolocalization of cathepsins B(CB), H and L and cystatins alpha(C alpha) and beta(C beta) were examined in the hippocampus of cases of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (12 cases), parkinsonism-dementia complex on Guam (eight cases), senile dementia of Alzheimer type (two cases), aged subjects with marked senile change (one case) and controls (12 cases, including six normal subjects). CB was lower in most nerve cells in patients than in controls, but markedly increased at the sites of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and degenerative neurites and/or dendrites in and outside senile plaques (SPs), indicating its close involvement in the metabolisms of various proteins in NFT and SPs. Abundant C alpha and C beta were demonstrated in SP amyloid, suggesting that they are amyloid constituents or co-exist with amyloid. The present study indicated that CB, C alpha and C beta are closely involved in abnormal protein metabolism in NFTs and SP amyloid and suggested that degeneration or denaturation of intracellular proteins, including substrates for proteases and lysosomes, from some acquired cause, results in absolute and/or relative overload for these proteolytic systems, including their inhibitors. This results in incomplete and/or abnormal proteolysis related to NFT and/or amyloid formation.
