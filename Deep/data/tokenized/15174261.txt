Hibernation (winter sleep) is a kind of unique adaptive behavior of small mammals subjected to fine and complex central control. One of the most promising approaches to this problem is a search for the mechanisms providing brain control under conditions of a sharp decrease in temperature, (virtually, to zero) and metabolic rate. Studies conducted at the Laboratory of System Organization of Neurons under the supervision of Professor O.S. Vinogradova confirmed the hypothesis of the special role of the septohippocampal system in the control of winter sleep. Together with a brief characterization of hibernation in general, the data obtained at the Laboratory are also summarized in the review. The experimental evidence for the role of the medial septal area as a "sentry post" in hibernation is presented.
