PURPOSE: Quantification of increased T2-weighted MRI signal that is associated with hippocampal sclerosis (HS) can be performed through (1) mean of hippocampal signal in single-echo T2 MRI and (2) hippocampal T2 relaxometry. It is not clear whether these two techniques are equivalent. In this study, we compare the hippocampal signal, detected by single-echo T2 quantification and by T2 relaxometry, in patients with medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). METHODS: We studied magnetic resonance images from 50 MTLE patients and 15 healthy subjects. We compared the quantification of a T2 signal from single echo images to T2 relaxometry, both obtained from a manually traced region of interest (ROI) in coronal slices involving the whole hippocampus. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to evaluate the differences in the distribution of the Z-scores from single-echo T2 quantification and T2 relaxometry within subjects. RESULTS: We observed a significant difference between the measurements obtained from single-echo T2 quantification and T2 relaxometry (P < .001). Measurements from head, body, and tail of the hippocampus were different (P=.04), with a significant interaction between anatomic location and type of measurement used (P= .008). Post hoc paired comparisons revealed that T2 relaxometry yielded greater Z-scores for the body (P= .002) and tail (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: For each subject with MTLE, T2 relaxometry was able to detect a higher signal in the body and tail of the hippocampus compared to single-echo T2. This is a possible indicator that T2 relaxometry is more sensitive in detecting T2 abnormalities within the body and tail of the hippocampus in patients with MTLE.
