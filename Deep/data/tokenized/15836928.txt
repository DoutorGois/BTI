Local protein synthesis in neuronal dendrites is one of the mechanisms that may mediate a rapid and synapse-specific mobilization of proteins from the resident mRNAs. A great deal of effort has been made in analyzing the dynamic state of protein synthesis in the living cells chiefly by quantifying protein level. However, the protein level cannot mirror the spatiotemporal alteration of translation because it can be affected, not only by protein synthesis, but also by other factors, like degradation. Therefore, it is problematic to visualize the dynamic state of translation by the present methods. To solve the problem, we applied fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) technique to in situ detection of the assembly and disassembly cycle among a pair of translation initiation factors [eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs)], thereby showing that BDNF and ephrin could potentiate local protein synthesis in the dendrites of hippocampal neurons.
