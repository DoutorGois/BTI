The ultrastructure of neurons, synapses and astrocytes of hippocampal CA1 area in rats was investigated 14 days after: systemic injection of kainic acid and kainic acid and myo-Inositol. After injection of kainic acid numerous neurons with superficial and deep ultrastructural changes of cytoplasmic organelles were described. Among synapses numerous forms with osmiophilic active zone and single synaptic vesicles, also presynaptic terminals with core vesicles were often seen. After kainic acid + myo-Inositol injection the cells with superficial changes of organelles dominated and the synapsoarchitectonics of the area was close to normal. Thus, electrono-microscopic data indicate possible neuroprotective (antiepileptic?) features of myo-Inositol.
